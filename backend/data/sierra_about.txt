About Sierra AI

Company Overview

Sierra is the conversational AI platform that makes every customer interaction extraordinary. We help businesses deploy AI agents that understand, assist, and delight customers at scale.

Founded by Bret Taylor (former Co-CEO of Salesforce, former CTO of Facebook) and Clay Bavor (former VP at Google, led Google Labs), Sierra brings together decades of experience in building products used by billions of people.

Our Mission

Elevate every customer experience through conversational AI that is helpful, natural, and genuinely useful.

We believe that customer service shouldn't feel like a chore. It should be effortless, personalized, and actually solve problems. AI agents are the key to making this vision a reality.

What We Do

Sierra provides an end-to-end platform for building, deploying, and managing conversational AI agents. Our platform enables businesses to:

Company Culture and Values

Customer Obsession
We start with the customer and work backwards. Every feature, every decision, every line of code is evaluated through the lens of customer value.

Velocity and Iteration
We move fast. We ship often. We learn from real usage and iterate quickly. We believe in progress over perfection.

Technical Excellence
We're building infrastructure that will power millions of conversations. Quality, reliability, and scalability are non-negotiable.

Radical Transparency
We share context broadly, communicate openly, and trust our team with the full picture. Good decisions require good information.

Ownership Culture
Everyone at Sierra is an owner. We take responsibility for outcomes, not just tasks. We see things through.

The Team

Our team includes AI researchers, product designers, engineers, and business leaders from companies like Google, Meta, Salesforce, Stripe, and leading AI labs.

We're a small, focused team that believes in hiring exceptional people and giving them the autonomy to do their best work.

Funding and Backers

Sierra is backed by leading investors including Sequoia Capital and Benchmark, with participation from prominent founders and AI researchers.

Our Approach to AI Safety

We take AI safety seriously. Our platform includes:

• Content filters and safety guardrails
• Human oversight and escalation protocols
• Transparency about AI agent capabilities and limitations
• Privacy-first data handling
• Regular audits and red-teaming exercises

We believe AI should augment human capabilities, not replace human judgment in critical situations.

Why Sierra?

AI agents will fundamentally transform how businesses interact with customers. We're at the beginning of this transformation, and the opportunity is enormous.
