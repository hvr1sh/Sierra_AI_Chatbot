    "content": "How SiriusXM drives listener loyalty with Sierra\n| Sierra\nSkip to main content\nSiriusXM is a leading audio entertainment company in North America, led by its flagship subscription service connecting millions of listeners to exclusive music, sports, talk and podcast programming they love. SiriusXM is uniquely differentiated in both its content offering and technology, which includes both direct integrations with vehicles from major automotive manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada as well as a newly-relaunched streaming app that allows for seamless listening throughout a listener’s day.\nThe company is primed for growth, and with new branding, pricing, product experience, and content investments unveiled in 2023, SiriusXM is on a path to reach and connect with a new generation of fans.\nTransforming customer service with AI\nAs SiriusXM works to satisfy its subscribers, it is also at the forefront of creative thinking about the future of customer service with conversational AI. SiriusXM handles millions of customer enquiries every year. As the company began preparing for the next stage of growth, it needed to think near-term and long-term.\n“Applied correctly, advanced AI will rapidly transform the self-service space by providing superior, low-effort natural language customer experiences in every channel,” said Moshe Pridan, Chief Product Officer and Chief Information Officer at SiriusXM.\nPrior to Sierra, no product had been able to seamlessly blend the flexibility of natural language with the ability to execute complex processes.\n“\nApplied correctly, advanced AI will rapidly transform the self-service space by providing superior, low-effort natural language customer experiences in every channel.\n”\nMoshe Pridan\nSVP of Product Management at SiriusXM\nStreamlining conversations with Sierra\nIn recent years, the SiriusXM Listener Care team has worked continuously to improve the customer's self-service experience, including building a traditional chatbot. The scope of work required to launch a chatbot was broad, from selecting appropriate self-service use cases, to gathering documentation, to aligning on official policies across teams. The team spent months ensuring that outcomes from a self-service chat would mirror the outcomes from a live support interaction. This comprehensive package of information was then translated into rules for the chatbot.\nUnfortunately, even the most thoughtfully constructed chatbots are limited and deterministic. Chatbots are architected to follow predefined paths, use keywords for understanding, and deliver a fixed set of outcomes. Because they are unable to understand context or human language, chatbots can result in dead-ends and escalations to human agents, increasing customer frustration.\nFor example, consider a customer asking for help “rejiggering a radio.” This request uses wording that a traditional chatbot is unable to process.\nAlternatively, consider a customer asking, “Where can I find Howard?” A traditional chatbot is unable to reference the concept of SiriusXM as a media company, “Howard” as host Howard Stern, or the concept of “Where” as asking for a channel.\nThe team at SiriusXM began to explore ways to break through the ceiling. They quickly understood that advanced AI could be applied to significantly improve the customer service experience, and potentially contain more calls. SiriusXM worked with Sierra to build their first generative AI agent.\nThe team at SiriusXM appreciated Sierra's dedication to quality and cutting-edge platform, which has allowed them to create an entirely new approach to customer service designed to better serve listeners and deliver the best possible experience across their business.\nTailoring AI to the needs of a unique subscriber business\nSiriusXM wanted to achieve immediate and meaningful impact with AI, while also implementing a solution that could scale over the long-term. They identified several top use cases for conversational AI, including helping subscribers refresh their in-car radio, make a payment, and update their billing information.\nAlthough these were popular use cases for SiriusXM customers, the team also acknowledged that they might be distinctive to their business. “Sending a refresh signal to a customer’s car radio presents a unique set of requirements and challenges. We knew it would require special knowledge and the ability to follow well-defined steps,” says Moshe. “We questioned at first whether modern AI would be able to adapt to this specific set of knowledge while maintaining flexibility and adaptability.”\nSierra and SiriusXM worked quickly to understand the set of needs and build a highly-tailored AI agent, affectionately called Harmony. Harmony soon aligned to SiriusXM’s business requirements and began testing top use cases in production.\nWith Sierra, SiriusXM is seeing conversational interactions they had never imagined before from an automated solution, especially in terms of usefulness.\n“We knew from using ChatGPT that a system could be built to converse naturally and be helpful, but the agent’s ability to\nalso\nfollow rules and incorporate SiriusXM-specific knowledge wowed us from the very start,” says Moshe. “When customers can have a natural conversation instead of filling out a form, they can be more specific about what they need, and they often share helpful feedback with us as well. Sierra is a game-changer for meeting a subscriber’s current needs, but it also helps us get ahead of any future questions. For every interaction, we also gain valuable insights to get in front of potential future issues.”\n“\nWhen customers can have a natural conversation instead of filling out a form, they can be more specific about what they need, and they often share helpful feedback with us as well.\n”\nMoshe Pridan\nSVP of Product Management, SiriusXM\nSierra currently handles a portion of SiriusXM's chat-based support cases, and will be rolling out more broadly this year.\nAbout the company\nSiriusXM is a leading audio entertainment company in North America, supercharging customer service for its flagship service with a new technology platform to bring the best of music, sports, talk and podcasts to millions of listeners.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nMedia\nFeaturing\nMoshe Pridan\nChief Product Officer & Chief Information Officer\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "content": "How Minted blends artistry with AI to transform customer experiences. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nMinted has transformed how people connect with independent artisans by creating a global marketplace for beautifully crafted, unique products. From holiday cards to wedding invitations and custom art, Minted’s platform brings the world’s most talented designers to consumers’ fingertips. The company’s mission is clear: to celebrate creativity and individuality by championing artists and making their work accessible to everyone.\n“At Minted, every product tells a story, and every design comes from a person with a unique perspective,” says Sarah Wallis, COO at Minted. “Our job is to preserve and strengthen the connection between customer and artist, no matter how much we grow.”\nTo honor this commitment, Minted uses AI to make it easier and faster for customers to resolve problems that stand between customers and the personalized products they’ve purchased.\n“\nOur job is to preserve and strengthen the connection between customer and artist, no matter how much we grow.\n”\nSarah Wallis, Chief Operating Officer\nScaling personal experiences during peak season\nMinted’s business is as unique as the products it offers. The company doesn’t just sell items; it curates deeply personal experiences for its customers.\nDuring the holiday card season, these moments come in waves, with the customer service team managing an extraordinary influx of inquiries—orders to track, designs to revise, and tight deadlines to meet. A simple question like “Where’s my order?” could mean clarifying a card’s status across design approval, printing, and shipping stages. These intricate needs demand an agent capable of understanding Minted’s unique processes and guiding customers with clarity and care.\nRecognizing this complexity, Minted partnered with Sierra to implement an AI agent that could support the diverse inquiries their team receives. For instance, when customers need help uploading addresses for holiday cards, the agent provides step-by-step guidance. If someone accidentally approves a design proof that needs adjustments, the AI ensures corrections can be made swiftly and seamlessly. And for customers navigating the emotional urgency of last-minute orders, the agent offers real-time updates and practical solutions to ensure Minted delivers on time.\n“Our customers rely on Minted for some of the most personal moments of their lives,” explains Anissa Gomez, Minted’s Quality Specialist. “It’s critical that our AI agent not only provides accurate information but also does so in a way that reflects our care for each customer’s unique needs.”\n“\nOur customers rely on Minted for some of the most personal moments of their lives. It’s critical that our AI agent not only provides accurate information but also does so in a way that reflects our care for each customer’s unique needs.\n”\nAnissa Gomez, Minted’s Quality Specialist\nAdapting to peak season spikes\nAs Minted experienced an exponential increase in volume over the peak season, their AI agent proved invaluable in maintaining exceptional customer service while adapting to new challenges in real time.\nThe AI agent was able to connect seamlessly to Minted’s other customer support platforms, including the company’s critical web experience platform. This holistic view into the customer experience has transformed how Minted identifies and resolves customer issues. Rather than relying on manual intervention, they can now detect trends, flag potential problems, and route insights to the right teams in real time. \"This was an unanticipated win for us,\" says Anissa.\nFor example, when a promotion code challenge emerged, the team caught and fixed it within hours of the first customer-reported issue—preventing customer frustration and avoiding a lengthy process of filing tickets and waiting on the appropriate teams to respond. The AI agent's real-time flexibility also enabled on-the-fly updates, like dynamically adjusting messaging to reflect current wait times, automatically upgrading customers to priority shipping if their orders were delayed, or proactively collecting necessary information to streamline interactions.\nThese innovations not only reduced back-and-forth communication but also empowered Minted to handle their biggest sales day ever without missing a beat. This streamlined approach accelerates resolution times, enhances the customer experience, and enables proactive problem-solving at scale.\n“A platform like Sierra becomes completely embedded in what we do,” says Sarah. “It’s interacting with customers and intertwined with CMS, OMS, and ecommerce. We don’t take those decisions lightly.”\nMeasurable impact on customer experience\nThe results speak for themselves. Since implementing their AI agent, Minted has achieved case resolution rates exceeding 65% for cases the AI agent is designed to handle. These inquiries often involve some of the most time-sensitive and detailed customer requests, from revising wedding invitations to ensuring holiday orders arrive under the tree on time. All the while, the AI agent achieves over a 95% CSAT rating.\n“This isn’t just about automation,” adds Sarah. “It’s about creating a better, faster experience that still feels personal and thoughtful.”\nBy integrating seamlessly with Minted’s processes, the AI agent has not only boosted efficiency but also empowered the customer service team to focus on more complex cases, ensuring that no customer feels like just another ticket in a queue.\nStrategic vision for AI-enabled growth\nMinted sees their AI agent as more than just a tool for today—it’s a foundation for future innovation. As part of an upcoming “Voice of the Customer” initiative, insights from AI-managed chat conversations will inform marketing, engineering, and product teams, enabling Minted to evolve based on real customer needs.\n“Our focus is on long-term transformation,” says Sarah. “The insights we’re gaining now are shaping how we serve customers tomorrow.”\nWith Sierra as a partner, Minted is poised to grow even faster without compromising the artistry and individuality that set them apart. By connecting people with exceptional artists, Minted ensures every purchase tells a story—one enriched by thoughtful, AI-driven customer support.\nAbout the company\nMinted is an inclusive artist forum where anyone can submit ideas.

    "content": "How Casper turns a big purchase into a lifelong relationship with AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nSince its launch in 2014, Casper has been on a mission to transform how people experience sleep. As the pioneer of the \"mattress-in-a-box\" concept, Casper disrupted traditional retail channels by creating a modern, direct-to-consumer model that emphasized convenience and simplicity. This approach helped Casper rapidly grow into a billion-dollar brand. Now, Casper is evolving its customer experience yet again, using AI to deliver personalized, always-on service.\nDreaming up a new shopping experience\nBuying a mattress is a significant decision that requires careful consideration. Traditional mattress shopping—characterized by high-pressure sales tactics—no longer appeals to today's consumers. Casper aimed to create an easy, pressure-free experience, but its initial chatbot, Luna, fell short. Luna couldn’t meet the varied needs of customers and often escalated inquiries to call center teams.\nMeet Luna 2.0\nTo revolutionize its customer experience, Casper partnered with Sierra to launch Luna 2.0, an AI-powered agent designed to build lifelong relationships. Luna 2.0 assists customers beyond their initial mattress purchase, offering support for pillows, bed frames, and other sleep-related products. The goal is simple: make the shopping experience so smooth that customers return to Casper as their needs evolve.\n“We’re using AI to meet customers where they are,” says Danny Cassotta, Sr. Manager of Customer Experience. “Our goal isn’t just to sell them a mattress—it’s to be their partner for every phase of their sleep journey.”\nCasper’s AI agent integrates seamlessly with internal systems to provide personalized, real-time responses and recommendations. Marc Butakis, VP of Operations, adds, “Initially I was a bit skeptical. I've seen a lot of different systems and promised seemingly unattainable results, but this has been a welcome surprise. Our service has fundamentally changed. With the AI agent, we effectively have 24/7 availability and engage in any language—something we couldn't do before.”\n“\nOur service has fundamentally changed. With the AI agent, we effectively have 24/7 availability and engage in any language—something we couldn't do before.\n”\nMarc Butakis, VP of Operations\nScaling support 24/7\nLuna 2.0 quickly surpassed expectations, efficiently resolving over 50% of inquiries across all customer needs. For product-related questions, an impressive 70% were handled without any need for human involvement.\nDuring peak seasons, Luna 2.0 scales with traffic. As the traffic doubled during the Labor Day Sale, for example, Luna 2.0 maintained a high-quality, consistent customer experience, effortlessly scaling with a 74% resolution rate. This not only reduced service costs but also streamlined Casper’s sales operations.\nHelping to drive these continued results are Alie Leahy, CX Project Manager, and Antonia Young, Sr. Fraud & System Analyst. Every day, Alie and Antonia go through customer conversations with Luna 2.0 to ensure the agent has up-to-date information to meet customer needs. If they identify updates required, they are able to flag issues or create new knowledge articles to ensure that the agent can handle inquiries without escalation. Their dedication has been crucial to the AI's ability to adapt and continually improve its resolution rate.\nBeyond sales events, the AI operates 24/7, 365 days a year, ensuring continuous customer support that would be difficult and costly to sustain with call center agents alone.\nMeaningful conversations, improved engagement, and higher CSAT\nLuna 2.0 has been able to deliver a 20% increase in customer engagement, with many customers feeling more at ease discussing their sleep preferences with the AI than with a salesperson. “It’s fascinating to see how open people are to having a meaningful, consultative, and personal conversation with AI,” says Danny.\nCorrespondingly, Casper CSAT scores have gone up by nearly a point. Call center teams can handle more complex cases, while the Luna 2.0 has a direct, redundancy-free approach that helps customers quickly find solutions to problems.\n“In the past, 97% of our interactions began with small talk to be polite or to gather information to which we already had access,\" Marc explains. “These additions would sometimes increase handle times by a minute. AI doesn’t hesitate—it's direct and efficient while maintaining a conversational tone. Among other things, good service is resolving the customer's issue quickly so that they can get back to their regular lives.\n“\nIt’s fascinating to see how open people are to having a meaningful, consultative and personal conversation with AI.\n”\nDanny Cassotta, Sr. Manager Customer Experience\nBuilding loyalty, one great night of sleep at a time\nCasper’s innovative use of AI has allowed the company to not only improve operational efficiency but also deliver modern, multichannel customer experiences. By transforming a significant one-time purchase into a series of delightful interactions, Casper is laying the foundation for lifelong loyalty and better sleep for all.\nAbout the company\nCasper, a leader in sleep innovation, is redefining the customer experience with AI.

    "content": "How ADT deploys a Sierra AI agent to make every second count\n| Sierra\nSkip to main content\nFor over 150 years, ADT has been a leader in home security, dedicated to helping customers protect what matters most—their families, homes, and businesses. In recent years, the company has embarked on a transformation, leveraging AI and other technologies to enhance its products and customer care.\nThe launch of the proprietary ADT+ platform marked a significant step in this journey, enabling the company to introduce new services and products more rapidly and effectively. This platform, along with the ADT+ mobile app, has received positive feedback, particularly following the introduction of features like Trusted Neighbour.\nDelivering faster, more flexible customer care\nManaging millions of customer interactions each month, including two million care requests, ADT recognised the need to elevate its customer care interactions—from password resets to account management and service appointments—to match the quality of its product offerings. This required a concerted effort across technology, channels, and teams, with clearly defined performance metrics.\nUnderstanding that any technology investment must amplify their commitment to customer safety and satisfaction, ADT approached the integration of AI with deliberate care. The company sought to identify specific problems that AI could solve, bringing real value to both customers and employees. Central to this initiative was the principle that \"every second counts,\" emphasising the importance of resolving customer issues quickly and effectively, especially for those seeking self-service options.\nFinding a partner\nKnowing that AI will play a key role in its ongoing customer experience transformation, ADT has been laying much of the groundwork for this shift by unifying data. But a strong data foundation isn’t enough. ADT needs partners who are experts not only in the technology but also know how to strategically apply it to customer care.\nSierra emerged as a standout partner, offering strategic insight and relevant expertise. Unlike providers offering generic solutions, Sierra collaborated closely with ADT to integrate the company's brand and customer requirements, deploying an AI agent capable of adapting and supporting multiple areas of the business over time. ADT's leaders saw Sierra not just as a technical solution, but a partner with which to rethink the company's holistic approach to customer experience—a mutual commitment to innovating and scaling in ways that benefit ADT’s customers, agents, and overall business.\nAccelerating beyond customer support\nAs part of their transformation, ADT\nlaunched a Sierra AI agent to handle a variety of customer Help Centre questions—from troubleshooting inquiries like “Why is my system beeping?” to account and billing questions like “How do I sign up for EasyPay?” or “How do I change my password?” Soon, their AI agent will have expanded capabilities, offering customers the ability to make a payment, reschedule a service visit, order yard signs or batteries, and more.\nThis is just the start for ADT. Customer care was chosen as the place to start the company’s AI journey. Given the scale of impact possible, however, ADT intends to evaluate and find new ways to evolve many parts of the business, leveraging AI and technology. Early partners like Sierra are key to setting the right vision, pace, and proof points for what can be achieved, helping companies like ADT not just improve today's customer experience, but inspiring where they go tomorrow.\nAbout the company\nADT, a leader in smart home security, deploys an AI agent to deliver an enhanced and scaled care experience for their customers, giving them more peace of mind as they protect what matters most - their families, homes and businesses.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nTechnology\nWith Sierra since\nAugust 2024\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "Marshmallow | Sierra",
    "content": "Marshmallow | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nWhen Marshmallow launched in 2017, it set out to solve a problem most insurance providers weren’t even looking at: the unfair premiums charged to people who move to the UK. “Migrants get penalized because their overseas driving experience doesn’t count,” explains Paul Elliott, Director of Data Science & AI at Marshmallow. “Even if you’ve been driving for 20 years, you’re treated like a new driver. That leads to unnecessarily high prices, and we knew we could do better.”\nToday, Marshmallow serves over 200,000 customers, nearly 80% of whom are new to the UK. The company builds its own technology and pricing models to offer fairer car insurance, tailored specifically to people who have relocated from abroad. It’s a mission grounded in purpose: to back people who step outside the norm and help them access the same financial opportunities as everyone else.\nBut for Marshmallow, affordability alone isn’t enough. As a highly regulated insurer serving multilingual, globally diverse customers, the company also needs to deliver clear, responsive, and human-centered support. That’s where AI came in.\nFrom rigid flows to real self-service\nBefore Sierra, Marshmallow relied on traditional support flows that had grown organically but inefficiently over time. “They worked to a degree,” Paul says, “but there was very little true self-service, and customers couldn’t take meaningful actions like updating their policies.”\nThat smarter solution needed to go beyond templated responses or static flows. Marshmallow wanted an AI agent that could understand nuance, take real actions, and handle sensitive pricing decisions—particularly around cancellations, updates to a policy (like a change of address or vehicle), and renewals. That search led them to Sierra.\nBuilding Marsha together\nMarshmallow’s AI agent, affectionately named Marsha, was developed in close partnership with Sierra using its Agent SDK. While Sierra’s team handled much of the implementation, Marshmallow’s engineers and data scientists played an active role in shaping Marsha’s capabilities and behavior.\n“It wasn’t just about delivery; it was a real collaboration,” Paul explains. “We didn’t want an agent handed to us as a black box. We wanted to understand it, shape it, and own it going forward.”\nThat autonomy mattered. With help from Sierra, Marshmallow’s team incorporated their own APIs, and built a full feedback loop for daily iteration and deployment. According to Paul, the two teams met in daily standups and pushed updates every day or two, even across time zones. The turnaround was fast, focused, and impressively coordinated.\n“\nIt wasn’t just about delivery; it was a real collaboration. We didn’t want an agent handed to us as a black box. We wanted to understand it, shape it, and own it going forward.\n”\nPaul Elliott, Director of Data Science & AI\nQuantifiable impact\nMarsha isn’t just helpful; she’s high-performing. Marshmallow uses an Internal Quality Score, or IQS, that takes into account many factors, including regulatory compliance. On this, “Marsha often scores higher than our average human agent,” Paul notes. “That’s huge in a business as tightly regulated as insurance.”\nCustomer satisfaction scores for AI-handled conversations exceed 82%, with consistently strong qualitative feedback. Customers often describe Marsha as fast, professional, polite, and easy to use. While human agents still score higher in overall CSAT, Marsha has proven herself highly effective in managing the routine but essential interactions that make up the bulk of Marshmallow’s service volume.\n“Some conversations really benefit from a human in the loop,” Paul acknowledges. “But others, like renewing a policy or checking for a better price, are perfect for an AI agent. And if that agent can help a customer save money in a way that’s fast and friendly, that’s an amazing outcome.”\nLessons for AI leaders\nFor Paul, building Marsha wasn’t just about launching a tool—it was about creating a new kind of capability within the company. One of his biggest recommendations for other leaders is to involve internal teams early—especially those closest to day-to-day customer interactions.\nAt Marshmallow, the customer service and operations teams played a critical role in mapping out high-impact journeys and identifying the scenarios Marsha needed to support. Their deep expertise in how to talk to customers directly shaped the agent’s design and tone, ensuring it reflected the company’s values and struck the right balance of clarity and empathy.\nPaul also urges leaders to involve QA teams early, noting, “They’re essential to ensuring the agent communicates with clarity, accuracy, and empathy, especially given the compliance and pricing implications of AI-powered conversations.\"\nFinally, he highlights the importance of autonomy.

    "content": "How Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nTubi, the free streaming platform, has built its brand around democratizing access to content. With a mission to provide all people access to all the world’s stories, swift, accurate customer support is crucial. But as the company scaled to serve millions of viewers worldwide, its customer experience team faced a familiar challenge: how do you maintain that personal touch when operating at massive scale?\nThe answer, as Blake Bassett and James Jones discovered, was about leaning into customer experience as a strategic advantage—one that emphasized turning support interactions into what they call \"magical moments.\"\n\"I've always viewed customer support not just as an operational expenditure, but as a growth engine,\" says Blake Bassett, Tubi’s VP of Product. \"How do you move beyond transactional interactions to provide value to both the audience and the business?\"\nThis philosophy runs deep at Tubi, where the brand's unique value proposition—free, ad-supported content that spans global stories—creates both opportunity and complexity.\n\"Customer experience is such a key part of Tubi's brand and how we engage with our users,\" explains James Jones, who leads the brand’s AI initiatives and works closely with Blake on customer experience strategy. \"We get a lot of different users on our application with different expectations and needs. Whether they're watching content at home with their families, on the go, or between exams, viewers often reach out looking to understand how to find content or how to better use the application.\"\nThe team's vision was ambitious: transform every customer interaction into an opportunity to create deeper connections with customers through swift issue resolution and personalized content recommendations. To bring this vision to life, they partnered with Sierra.\nDesigning for customer experiences that inspire\nBefore partnering with Sierra, Tubi's customer support operated through a traditional email system. \"Users would send messages via our form, and our customer support agents would respond via email. Very old-school methodology, especially when people are used to more message-based systems,\" James recalls.\nThe limitations were stark. Response times stretched across hours. Peak viewing times—evenings, weekends, major sporting events—created impossible staffing challenges. \"How do you 10x your team for an hour?\" James asks, highlighting a core operational dilemma.\nWhen Tubi decided to modernize their customer experience, the build-versus-buy decision wasn't taken lightly. \"We're early adopters of AI and had built agentic systems internally,\" Bassett notes. The team had the technical chops to build their own solution—but they recognized the value of the right partner. The decision came down to more than technology. \"We decided to buy instead of build because of the white-glove onboarding and training,\" Bassett says. \"We thought Sierra was the horse worth betting on, and we've been very pleased—it's come through and delivered.\"\nThe implementation focused on two core capabilities that align directly with Tubi's mission: technical support and personalized content discovery. The Sierra-powered agent handles everything from troubleshooting streaming issues to password resets, but it's the content recommendation capability that truly embodies Tubi's vision.\n\"We believe in creating what we call 'magical moments'—really human exchanges where we share something we love with someone else,\" Blake explains. \"The interesting thing about Sierra is being able to do that at a much larger scale in our brand voice, essentially recommending content by hitting an API endpoint of our catalog and using what we know about the user to recommend something that will resonate with them.\"\n“\nWe believe in creating what we call 'magical moments'—really human exchanges where we share something we love with someone else. The interesting thing about Sierra is being able to do that at a much larger scale in our brand voice.\n”\nBlake Bassett, VP of Product\nWith the agent deployed, those once-tricky staffing challenges simply disappeared—the AI agent absorbs the demand spikes during prime time and live events, maintaining consistent service quality whether it's 3PM on a Tuesday or the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl.\nFrom support interactions to actionable intelligence\nThree months post-launch, the results have been transformative—and surprising. \"I was probably most nervous about CSAT going down,\" James admits. \"I had hypothesized that people really want a human-to-human interface, and sending them to AI would bring our CSAT down. But what I realized is that people want answers—they want resolutions to their issues.\"\n“\nI had hypothesized that people really want a human-to-human interface, and sending them to AI would bring our CSAT down. But what I realized is that people want answers—they want resolutions to their issues.\n”\nJames Jones, AI & Enterprise Platforms\nThe numbers tell the story: CSAT increased by seven percentage points, containment reached 80%, and resolution times shifted from hours or days to minutes.\nPerhaps most importantly, the agent has freed up the human team to focus on higher-value work. \"Now they're spending more time providing insights to the rest of the organization about what users are saying, which influences roadmaps and helps our engineers better understand where to address technical debt,\" James explains. \"It's enabled our teams to focus not just on answering questions, but providing insights that are useful to the business as a whole.\"\nMeanwhile, through the partnership, Tubi’s CX team has experienced a mindset shift—and leveled up their AI skills at the same time. \"Often when working with AI and customer experience teams, it can be nerve-wracking—’What does this mean for what I'll be doing in the future?’,” James says. “But after going through [Sierra’s customer-facing training program] Sierra University, I've seen our customer experience team energized and actually building on their own to help improve our agent. That's been pretty awesome.\"\nThe bigger vision: democratizing those magical moments\nAs streaming services increasingly compete on experience rather than just content, Tubi's approach offers a blueprint for the industry. By treating customer experience as a strategic advantage rather than a necessary cost, and by choosing the right AI partner to scale that vision, they've created a system that doesn't just resolve issues—it creates fans.\n\"Every interaction is an opportunity to create a fan for life,\" Bassett reflects. With Sierra, Tubi isn't just handling customer service at scale—they're delivering magical moments, one conversation at a time.\nAbout the company\nTubi is the free streaming service offering the largest collection of premium on-demand content, including over 275,000 movies and TV episodes and more than 300 exclusive originals.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nMedia\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit.\nReduction in subscription cancellations\n50%\nHair color trailblazer Madison Reed gives customer experience a glow-up with AI."

    "content": "How Sun & Ski’s AI agent “Sunny” turns approachability into sales. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nWhen Sicily Dickenson joined Sun & Ski Sports as CMO and Head of E-commerce in 2022, the Texas-based outdoor retailer was at an inflection point. They'd built a thriving brick-and-mortar business opening stores in unexpected markets and then expanded to resort markets. But customer behaviors were shifting, and the brand wanted to do more than just keep pace. Three years later, Sunny, their AI agent, has improved CSAT by 50% and tripled product page conversion rates…and they’re just getting started.\nAt first, the company set its sights on evolving from a predominantly in-store experience to a robust omnichannel operation. They faced a specific challenge: how do you scale the deep knowledge of your best outdoor experts who can guide both first time and black diamond skiers and snowboarders through complex decisions about skis, boards, boots, and bindings—across digital channels?\nMeanwhile, Sun & Ski's business is intensely seasonal, with most revenue happening in a 3-4 month winter window. This creates massive customer service spikes that historically required hiring a new crop of temporary representatives each year—a costly, disruptive cycle of recruiting, training, and managing seasonal staff.\nStarting small, thinking big\nMarcus Tyree, Sun & Ski's CFO and Head of Software, saw an opportunity. With a background spanning corporate banking and technology transformation work with Fortune 500 companies, he believed AI could help Sun & Ski achieve the expert knowledge depth of their best associates, with the asymmetric upside of digital delivery.\n\"I thought there was a unique opportunity for us to have a very approachable and knowledgeable conversational AI agent where people could ask it anything, at any time of day, and actually build that trust and confidence,\" Marcus recalls.\nBut selling that vision wasn't easy. The co-owners needed convincing. And Sicily? She was drowning in priorities, racing to build e-commerce infrastructure before the peak winter season.\nMarcus chose to partner with Sierra, betting on technology that was ready to deliver results immediately. He decided to start with simple use cases that would scale with seasonal demand, like handling basic returns and order status inquiries.\nAs Sicily's team watched the agent, affectionately named “Sunny,” answer increasingly sophisticated product questions, they had a realization: this could be so much more than support.\nSicily had been exploring an expensive third-party tool to answer product questions on detail pages, but decided to pause the process. After all, a better option was already in motion. Sunny moved beyond support into sales.\nAn approachable expert who never intimidates\nSunny's personality reflects the Sun & Ski Sports brand. She’s friendly, warm, and approachable—a direct contrast to competitors who often have intimidating, hardcore vibes that scare off novice athletes.\n\"You can ask Sunny anything. Sunny will never intimidate you,\" Sicily says. \"There are a lot of questions people ask Sunny that they would never have clicked on a chat, picked up the phone, or sent an email about.\"\n“\nYou can ask Sunny anything. Sunny will never intimidate you. There are a lot of questions people ask Sunny that they would never have clicked on a chat, picked up the phone, or sent an email about.\n”\nSicily Dickenson, CMO & Head of E-Commerce\nSunny helps shoppers by asking expert-level questions: What's your skill level? Powder or moguls? Which resorts? She handles the complexity of outdoor gear—will these skis work with those bindings and boots?—with remarkable depth.\n\"It's surprising how she can personalize in ways that aren't scalable with one human on a phone,\" Sicily reflects. \"Sometimes I'd see a conversation about skis where Sunny asked if they were a beginner or advanced skier—okay, normal question. Then she'd ask about powder or moguls. Then where they're skiing, what resorts. I'm like, I'm not sure if one of our outdoor experts could have even had this level of conversation unless they were from that particular area.\"\nNumbers tell the story: From connection to conversion\nThe results have been remarkable. Sunny achieves 90% customer satisfaction compared to 68% for conversations transferred to human agents. Customers who engage with Sunny convert at triple the rate of those who don't.\nShe's handled thousands of after-hours conversations in just three months. \"Those are conversations we wouldn't have fielded until the next day, if at all,\" Sicily notes. \"That is really helpful for us—and is helping us raise our customer satisfaction overall.\"\nAnd perhaps most impressively: despite growing e-commerce substantially year-over-year, Sun & Ski hasn't hired a single seasonal customer service agent this winter, eliminating the complexity of recruiting, training, and managing temporary staff during their crunch period.\nThe shift in Marcus's thinking was profound: \"There's a lot of people who see AI as immediately an expense-saving tool, but the true leverage is conversion. It starts with connection, which turns into conversion.\"\n“\nThere's a lot of people who see AI as immediately an expense-saving tool, but the true leverage is conversion.

    "title": "How Sonos elevates the listener experience with Sierra | Sierra",
    "content": "How Sonos elevates the listener experience with Sierra | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nA bold vision for the future of sound\nSonos was founded in 2002 with a mission to fill every home with music. After breakthrough research, prototyping, and rigorous testing, Sonos shipped its first revolutionary product in 2005, the ZP100. This was the first wireless audio product of its kind, with reviewers celebrating its simplicity of setup, design, reliability, and great sound. Over the course of the next two decades, Sonos has gone on to become a leader in sound experience with devices in more than 15 million homes all over the world.\nNaturally, Sonos has deep roots in technical excellence and product innovation. But, Sonos’ commitment to its 15 million customers has stretched beyond delivering groundbreaking products to delivering world-class listening experiences.\nThe Sonos focus on customer experience is central to all business functions. Dharam Rai, VP of Customer Experience at Sonos explains, “At many companies, customer support is a post-purchase function, measured as a cost center. At Sonos, customer support and serviceability are considered in every part of the planning and development process, from product development to go-to-market to loyalty.”\nAccelerating time-to-music\nThe true value of a Sonos speaker can only be appreciated when customers begin listening to their first song. To measure this, the company introduced a cross-functional metric called “time-to-music,” which captures all aspects of the customer experience, from order management to product usability and customer support.\nTo accelerate time-to-music, Sonos launched the F30 programs, designed to help customers accelerate during the first 30 days of their customer journey. “The team rallies to onboard customers and deliver an incredible new product experience,” says Dharam. “That first experience will shape the customer’s long-term relationship with our brand.”\nAs a part of this process, the Customer Experience team answers questions, helps with speaker setup, and troubleshoots issues across the entire wireless ecosystem, from network topology to accessing an IP address. “If we get messages from customers who need help fixing their router issues, we do whatever it takes to solve the problem,” says Dharam. “We have received thank-you notes from customers who love their new Sonos speaker, and are also grateful that their old printer finally works!”\nDharam Rai, VP of Customer Experience at Sonos\n“\nThe team rallies to onboard customers and deliver an incredible new product experience. That first experience will shape the customer’s long-term relationship with our brand.\n”\nDharam Rai\nVP of Customer Experience, Sonos\nIntroducing the Customer Effort Score\nMost customer experience organizations have a standardized set of metrics to evaluate operational performance, including average handle time, time-to-resolution, net promoter score (NPS), and customer satisfaction (CSAT). At Sonos, these interaction-based metrics were only one piece of the puzzle. In addition to “time-to-music,” Dharam wanted to measure how the customer experience team could create longer, stronger relationships.\nDharam’s team began connecting the varied, rich data from across the organization to understand customer sentiment, leading to the development of the Customer Effort Score. “The Customer Effort Score evaluates the customer experience beyond a one-time interaction, helping us understand the broader customer relationship,” explains Dharam.\nData points that are incorporated include the frequency, count and range of customer inquiries, measured alongside product usage and log data. “Did the customer call twice about the same problem? How many interactions have we had this month?” Dharam explains, “The Customer Effort Score allows us to be proactive with each conversation and tailor responses appropriately.”\nAligning AI with customer-obsession\nDharam and his team are always working to improve the customer experience. In late 2022, they began investigating alternative approaches to customer self-service beyond traditional chatbots, “Bots have a bad reputation in the industry –– for good reason. Bots are transactional. They’re ‘what if’ statements that feel static and lack empathy.”\nAs AI became a talking point in boardrooms and at dinner tables, Dharam considered how AI could be deployed for customer-facing interactions, improving the first 30 days and improving the Customer Effort Score. When he first saw what was possible with Sierra, he was impressed. “Sierra’s AI agent was able to deliver a humanness to conversations that was surprising,” shares Dharam. “The AI was able to thread together an entire conversation, understanding the context and relevance past comments. This has a humongous value in terms of reducing customer effort and creating a better experience.”\nBuilding the first Sonos AI agent\nThe Sonos AI agent is designed to help with a variety of first-30 day tasks. Sonos started with the simpler tasks, and quickly expanded to include setup of new products, solving for moved routers, managing orders and returns, and connecting with new music services. Each of these is multi-dimensional and nuanced. A well-trained customer experience representative can make these interactions seamless and easy for the customer, and Sierra was held to the same high standard.\nFor example, to set up a new product, the AI agent begins by asking the customer about the product and environment, and then collects basic diagnostic information. While a customer experience representative would have to swivel-chair between various systems, manuals and programs, the AI agent can instantly access relevant data. After the AI agent guides the customer through a product setup and confirms the customer is satisfied, the agent creates a case in Salesforce.\nWhen cases do need in-person support, the AI agent escalates to customer experience representatives with a summary of the issue, complete with relevant information. Managing a lighter caseload with better information, customer experience representatives can solve issues more quickly, effectively, and with less burnout.\nThroughout the development of the Sonos AI agent, the team found the AI to be dynamic, creative, and capable of meeting the expectations of a Sonos-quality customer experience. They are optimistic that the AI agent will help Sonos scale customer success while helping customers enjoy their Sonos products. “‘Time-to-music’ is a really important metric for us,'' says Dharam, “and we want to ensure that the journey from purchase to first listen is as seamless as possible.”\n“\nThe AI was able to thread together an entire conversation, remembering the context and relevance of past comments. This has a humongous value in terms of reducing customer effort and creating a better experience.\n”\nDharam Rai\nVP of Customer Experience, Sonos\nAbout the company\nSonos is the inventor of multi-room wireless home audio with devices in more than 15 million homes all over the world.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail and Consumer Goods\nWith Sierra since\nDecember 2023\nFeaturing\nDharam Rai\nVP, Customer Experience\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How CDW is reimagining B2B customer experience with Sierra | Sierra",
    "content": "How CDW is reimagining B2B customer experience with Sierra | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nCDW is one of the largest IT solutions providers in North America, serving more than 250,000 organizations across industries including business, education, healthcare, government, and others with hardware, software, and services. While CDW has long operated in the B2B world, its digital leaders set out to bring the ease and personalization of B2C commerce to the enterprise.\n\"We all carry expectations from our B2C lives into our B2B experiences,\" said Max Brown, VP of Product Design. \"And yet we’re often disappointed when the tools we use at work feel clunky or hard to navigate. We saw an opportunity to raise the bar, bringing the same high-quality experiences we enjoy as consumers into the enterprise space.\"\n“For us, great customer experience isn't just about solving a problem quickly. It's about reducing effort and making complex processes feel intuitive,\" said Ben Weiss, VP of Product Management.\n“\nFor us, great customer experience isn't just about solving a problem quickly. It's about reducing effort and making complex processes feel intuitive.\n”\nBen Weiss, VP of Product Management\nTogether, Max and Ben lead the digital experience across CDW’s website, e-commerce platform, and Rubi—the company’s logged-in portal for self-service IT procurement. To elevate the customer experience, they partnered with Sierra to launch a conversational AI agent built specifically for their B2B workflows.\nFrom complexity to clarity\nUnlike typical B2C buyers, CDW’s customers are often managing procurement at scale with contracts, budgets, approvals, and preferences that span teams and departments. Their needs are diverse, technical, and fast-moving. And many rely on direct relationships with account managers for guidance and support.\n\"Our ideal was never to replace the account manager,\" Max said. \"It was to create an AI agent that feels like an extension of that team. Someone who knows your business, understands what you need, and can help the moment you reach out.\"\nCDW launched their agent with Sierra to handle a range of high-volume use cases, including FAQs, order tracking, and document requests—like W-9s, which can spike seasonally and create unnecessary load on support teams. These interactions are frequent and often arrive in bulk, making them ideal for automation. By addressing these needs through the agent, the account managers are able to redirect focus to more strategic, consultative support. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes authenticated experiences like account insights, contract visibility, and subscription management.\n\"We’re starting with foundational cases that matter,\" said Ben. \"But the goal is to evolve toward truly personalized interactions where a customer can ask about their IT estate, get procurement insights, and manage renewals directly through the agent. That’s the kind of experience we’re building toward.\"\nWhat makes this especially meaningful is the nature of CDW’s user base. IT procurement professionals operate under time pressure and within complex organizational structures. They don’t just need answers—they need intelligent, context-aware support that helps them get work done. That’s where Sierra’s ability to reason, act, and adapt in real time becomes a strategic advantage.\nA partnership built on visibility and control\nFor CDW, Sierra’s value extended beyond the AI agent to the tools and infrastructure that support it. One standout example is Sierra’s Agent Studio, which gives the team deeper visibility into how the agent is being used and where it can improve.\n\"Agent Studio gives us visibility into what customers are asking and how the agent is performing,\" said Ben. \"That helps us define the roadmap and refine the experience over time. We don’t have to guess what’s working or what to build next. The data tells us.\"\nThat feedback loop is an essential part of how the teams work together to iterate, improve, and define their roadmap.\n\"There’s a relatively thick layer that Sierra builds on top of the LLMs, and that makes a huge difference,\" said Max. \"Sierra’s platform handles a deep layer of complexity—from routing and regression testing to audit traces and compliance—that allows us to focus on delivering business value and exceptional user experience. And the way Sierra has structured their teams to support our success has been impressive.\"\nSierra’s platform also plays a role in scalability. With tools for content management, performance insights, and rapid iteration, CDW’s product team can shape the agent over time, adapting to evolving business needs without rebuilding from scratch. It’s a system designed to learn, improve, and keep pace with both customer expectations and internal priorities.\nLaying the groundwork for scalable growth\nSierra’s agent plays a role in helping serve all 250,000 of CDWs customers across industries. Unlike B2C environments where volume is concentrated through a single channel, CDW’s customers engage in many ways—through account managers, online tools, and now, a conversational agent that adds scale and intelligence to every touchpoint. As new use cases go live and the agent is surfaced more prominently in Rubi, the team expects volume to grow meaningfully.\nMore than just volume, Max and Ben are focused on quality. They want their agent to feel like a real part of the CDW experience: helpful, informed, and aligned with the relationships their customers already value. \"This isn’t a one-and-done tool,\" said Max. \"It’s a new channel for customer experience. We’re just getting started, but it already feels like we’re building something foundational together.\"\n“\nThis isn’t a one-and-done tool, it’s a new channel for customer experience. We’re just getting started, but it already feels like we’re building something foundational together.\n”\nMax Brown, VP of Product Design\nLooking ahead, Max and Ben are excited about deepening the agent’s capabilities with more contextual understanding, predictive logic, and tighter integration into CDW’s broader systems. As Ben put it, \"The real opportunity is in how AI can surface patterns across customer interactions, help us proactively solve problems, and make our digital ecosystem smarter over time.\"\nThey also see potential for Sierra to help unify disparate workflows. In a landscape where IT procurement spans multiple departments, tools, and contract timelines, the agent could serve as a connective layer—guiding users to the right resources, surfacing critical information, and automating repeatable tasks.\nAs Max noted, \"This is about creating a digital teammate that actually contributes to the way our customers work. That’s a future we’re excited to help shape.\"\nAbout the company\nCDW is a leading multi-brand provider of information technology solutions to business, government, education and healthcare customers around the world.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nTechnology\nFeaturing\nMax Brown\nVP of Product Design\nBen Weiss\nVP of Product Management\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How CLEAR is elevating member hospitality with AI. | Sierra",
    "content": "How CLEAR is elevating member hospitality with AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nCLEAR is the secure identity platform that makes everyday experiences—like airport travel—faster, easier, and more secure. Whether through CLEAR Plus at the airport or biometric authentication in healthcare and retail, CLEAR delivers frictionless, high-trust interactions for millions of members.\nTo match the speed and simplicity of its product, CLEAR set out to create a member experience that felt just as seamless. “As we often say, ‘you are you.’ We believe you shouldn’t have to pull out your wallet or passport to prove who you are,” said Adam Luebbers, CLEAR’s VP of Member Experience. “Everything we do is about making experiences faster, easier, and more secure—and that includes member support.”\nOutgrowing a rigid system\nBefore Sierra, CLEAR used a traditional support tool limited to rigid, logic-based responses. It couldn’t infer intent, adapt its tone, or scale to meet the evolving needs of CLEAR’s growing member base. This created friction at key moments—exactly the kind of experience the team was working to eliminate. “Our previous tool wasn’t leveraging GenAI,\" said Adam. \"It lacked the context and fluidity we needed to truly support our members—and that’s a problem when your brand is obsessed with frictionless experiences.”\nIn searching for a new partner, CLEAR wanted more than a technology vendor. They needed a team that understood the importance of member-first design and hospitality. Sierra stood out not just for its product, but for its responsiveness and shared commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.\nTurning an AI agent into a member of the team\nCLEAR launched its AI agent built on Sierra across web and mobile, enabling members to ask questions about everything from airport locations and product details to account management and service comparisons. With the previous system, much of this information wasn’t available in the mobile app—and even on the web, the incumbent system struggled to handle nuance.\nWith Sierra, the experience feels dramatically different. “As an example, members are sometimes confused about the difference between CLEAR Plus and TSA PreCheck, and assume they need only one,” Adam said. “With Sierra, we’ve been able to clarify that the two are actually complementary. The agent explains how they work together to create a faster, more frictionless travel experience—which has been a game changer for member understanding and adoption.”\nJust as important as functionality was tone. From day one, CLEAR worked closely with Sierra to ensure the agent reflected the company’s brand voice. The teams exchanged process docs, past marketing communications, and live feedback to get it right. “I’ve been impressed with how quickly we’ve been able to tailor it,” Adam said. “It now speaks the way we do—warm, direct, and member-first.”\nAnd while Sierra is capable of handling thousands of interactions autonomously, it was never intended to replace the people behind CLEAR’s member care team. Rather, as Adam puts it, the AI agent is designed to “give our member care agents superpowers.”\n“Sierra gives us back time,” Adam said. “Our support team is now focused on more complex, meaningful conversations. If a member wants to speak to a human, that’s always an option. This is about augmentation, not elimination.”\n“\nSierra gives us back time. Our support team is now focused on more complex, meaningful conversations. If a member wants to speak to a human, that’s always an option. This is about augmentation, not elimination.\n”\nAdam Luebbers, VP, Member Experience\nMeasurable impact where it matters most\nIn the first few months post-launch, CLEAR began seeing meaningful improvements. The resolution rate increased, and even during Sierra’s training phase, customer satisfaction scores improved, reaching an average of 4.7. “We were looking for parity out of the gate, knowing there would be a learning curve,” said Adam. “But even in the early days, we saw substantial improvements. It’s already outperforming our expectations, and we still have a lot of room to grow.”\nThe impact extends to CLEAR’s internal teams as well. With Sierra handling a high volume of inquiries, member care agents are empowered to do more rewarding work. “The feedback from the team has been really positive,” Adam said. “They’re more engaged because the interactions they’re having are more complex and less repetitive. And the quality of the handoffs from Sierra has been excellent—it gives us a complete view of the member’s journey.”\nA roadmap for AI-enabled hospitality\nCLEAR views Sierra as a long-term innovation partner, and the roadmap for expansion is already underway. The team is exploring ways to embed the agent directly into the enrollment flow, providing support for potential members as they navigate sign-up. They are planning to expand into additional channels, including voice.

    "content": "How Ramp applies its engineering mindset to customer experience | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nRamp is on a mission to save its customers the two things they care about most: time and money. With an integrated platform that spans corporate cards, expense management, procurement, travel, and accounting automation, the company has reimagined how finance teams operate. But that transformation extends beyond software features. For Ramp, delivering on its promise requires a customer experience that's just as robust.\n\"Money is one of the most sensitive parts of any business, so performance and trust are non-negotiable,\" says Ben Levick, who leads customer operations and conversational AI products at Ramp. \"Support isn’t just about resolving issues—it's about helping customers get more value from Ramp.\"\nFrom homegrown to high-impact\nIn 2023, Ramp built an in-house AI assistant to deflect simple inquiries. While the results were promising, the technical burden of maintaining it became clear. \"We got to a point when building multi-step workflows and user-specific actions where we realized that support automation wasn't our core competency,\" Ben explains. \"We needed a partner whose focus was doing this at scale.\"\nA tipping point came when Ramp started to scale its AI agent beyond Q&A. \"Once we moved into personalization—looking up user data, taking actions for customers—we knew we had to move beyond our internal tooling,\" Ben says. \"It wasn’t sustainable to manage that level of complexity ourselves with a small team.\"\nWhy Sierra\nRamp needed an AI agent that could evolve as quickly as its own product. One key requirement: the ability to retain full engineering control without sacrificing speed. \"Sierra's Agent SDK stood out because it let us write customer journeys as code, track changes, and build sophisticated logic without giving up our development workflows,\" says Ben. \"It was the first solution that truly met our technical bar. It wasn’t a handoff of control. It felt like an extension of our engineering practice.\"\n“\nSierra's Agent SDK stood out because it let us write customer journeys as code, track changes, and build sophisticated logic without giving up our development workflows. It was the first solution that truly met our technical bar.\n”\nBen Levick, Operations and AI\nJust as important was the collaboration. Rather than acting as a vendor, Sierra partnered closely with Ramp to co-develop the agent. Ben describes the Sierra team as \"culturally aligned and deeply hands-on,\" enabling Ramp to move quickly while learning to build and maintain journeys independently. \"They’re not just shipping features—they’re teaching us to fish,\" he adds. \"That’s made all the difference.\"\nConfidence built in\nFor Ramp, one of the biggest advantages of working with Sierra is knowing that trust and safety are handled at the infrastructure level.\n“If we built our own system end-to-end, we’d have to own every dimension of abuse prevention and risk mitigation ourselves,” Ben explains. “With Sierra, we get to focus on building great customer journeys—knowing that safeguards like jailbreak detection, abuse monitoring, and supervisory models are already in place.” That peace of mind extends to conversation quality as well. Sierra’s orchestration layer and triage capabilities help prevent drift or rogue behavior, ensuring the agent stays on task without becoming overly rigid. “It’s a balance we don’t have to manually tune ourselves,” Ben says. “And that allows our team to stay tightly focused on the definition, design, and continuous improvement of the journeys themselves.”\nRamp also benefits from Sierra’s testing suite, which simulates conversations to test agent performance at scale before launch. This AI-driven testing framework supports regression checks, predictive analytics, and outcome-based evaluations—making it easier to validate changes, avoid unintended behavior, and anticipate business impact. “It gives us a level of testing we couldn’t build ourselves,” Ben adds. “We can ship confidently knowing the agent’s behavior is stable, reliable, and aligned with our goals.”\nDesigning for every user\nRamp's agent supports a wide and growing range of both user-initiated and admin workflows. Ramp cardholders can lock or replace a card with ease, or get quick explanations for transaction details and failures. The agent handles collecting and validating address information, streamlining the process for users who need to update their records—it can even ship a physical card. For admins, the agent can coordinate bulk actions to help streamline work, such as issuing multiple cards or pulling specific transaction data from across a business. These automations make operational tasks faster and more reliable.\nAll of these are built using the Agent SDK, ensuring that the journeys are easy to maintain, version, and expand. Ramp has also been experimenting with different interface styles to suit different users. “Some of our cardholders just want to get in and out fast,” Ben notes. “Others—like admins—want visibility and control. We’ve designed the agent to flex for both.”\nReal results, real impact\nSince launching the agent, Ramp has achieved a 90% case resolution rate through automation—dramatically reducing the volume of routine tickets and helping prevent support backlogs. This has allowed Ramp’s support specialists to focus their time and expertise on the most complex, high-value cases where their impact on the customer experience is greatest. “The Sierra agent takes care of the straightforward issues,” Ben says, “so our team can concentrate on the harder problems that really benefit from a human touch.”\nRamp also maintains a rigorous quality assurance loop, feeding data from Sierra back into its product ops and knowledge management teams. These teams manage not only product enablement for human agents, but also for AI. “We give product operators ownership of AI success in their domain,” Ben explains. “They’re reading transcripts, updating knowledge, and shaping journeys—just like they do for our support team.”\nThe team has already started rolling out their voice agent, which Ben says has evolved quickly: \"Even six months ago, voice agents still felt stuck in the uncanny valley. But Sierra's voice experience now handles context, follow-ups, and tone in a way that feels genuinely helpful.\"\nAdvice for others\nBen believes that AI agents are only as good as the teams that support them. At Ramp, knowledge management is embedded within the product org, with dedicated product ops partners tasked with enabling AI the same way they enable their support team. Weekly feedback loops help prioritize updates, whether it's refining a knowledge article or scoping a custom journey.\nThat emphasis on cross-functional ownership has made a big difference. \"When an AI agent fails, it’s often not because the model isn’t smart enough—it’s because the underlying knowledge is vague, or the prompt isn’t specific,\" Ben explains. “If you empower your team to be curious rather than skeptical, you’ll see major gains.”\nHis second piece of advice is to not underestimate support teams. “They often have the most context about what customers actually need,” Ben says. “If you invest in helping them work with AI—whether through process, training, or tools—they become your strongest operational thinkers. AI agents aren't set-it-and-forget-it. But if you invest in the right tooling, team structure, and partnerships, the payoff is massive.”\nWhat's next\nRamp is now expanding the agent across all support channels and exploring non-support use cases, where AI can support a growing conversational layer across the product. They're also interested in more autonomous patterns—agents that don't just respond, but observe and act based on defined signals. “In the future, we will see AI agents that monitor for certain conditions and then act—like a workflow trigger that lives inside a conversation,” Ben explains.\nUltimately, Ramp sees AI agents not as a novelty, but as a durable part of their operations. “We’ve only scratched the surface,” Ben says. “The more we build, the more opportunities we see to integrate AI deeply into how we serve and empower our customers.”\nAbout the company\nVisit site\nIndustry\nFinancial services\nFeaturing\nBen Levick\nOperations and AI\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How WeightWatchers embraces AI to engage members with empathy, at scale, with Sierra | Sierra",
    "content": "How WeightWatchers embraces AI to engage members with empathy, at scale, with Sierra | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nWeightWatchers is on a mission to be the global leader in weight health and to create a worldwide community connected by healthy habits. As a leader in the space for over 60 years, WW has evolved to provide new solutions across the health spectrum - all underpinned by a deep and respected heritage in behavior change.\nAs the company continues its transformation journey, it continues to remain loyal to the heart of its mission: caring for its members and meeting them where they are. “Customers have high expectations: they want the right answer, the first time, with empathy,” says Maureen Martin, VP of Customer Care. “My job is to deliver a fabulous experience for our members, while creating an attractive place for our talent to join, grow and thrive.”\nMaking AI your own\nMost customer care teams have to balance delivering a positive customer experience with driving operational efficiency, often finding ways to improve both simultaneously. The Customer Care team at WeightWatchers was no exception. They had invested in up-leveling their knowledge management system and self-service chatbots, and were continuing to look for ways to optimize operations. “In the past, if there was a policy change, our Customer Care team had 30 days to update the contact center. This included training, experimentation, practicing,” reflects Maureen. “Those days are long gone. We are embracing technology to move faster.”\nIn 2023, WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani encouraged the organization to explore what was possible with AI. “In today’s environment, the companies that succeed will be the ones that transform,” says Sistani. “My priority was ensuring the right leaders were on the project: doing, testing, seeing what was possible.”\nSima Sistani, CEO of WeightWatchers\n“\nWe're going to grow in ways that resonate with a more digitally forward consumer, and a key part of that will be embracing AI to help improve the member experience.\n”\nSima Sistani\nCEO, WeightWatchers\nMaureen and her team partnered with Sierra to build their first AI customer care Agent. A Sierra agent is AI-powered software that acts like an AI-version of your company, having conversations with your customers on behalf of your organization. Agents communicate using natural language, and are broadly capable. They are grounded in the knowledge of your company, adhere to your brand guidelines, and are able to access your systems in a secure and trusted way in order to take action on behalf of your customers.\nMaureen was excited to see that Sierra agents were flexible, quickly adapting to the distinctive characteristics of the business. “Every company has a unique vocabulary and language,” says Maureen. “For most companies, the word 'budget' has to do with finance. For us, it relates to how many Points in a day you can have for the foods you're selecting.”\nThe agent was imbued with WeightWatchers' information, knowledge base, policies, and brand guidelines, alongside guardrails defined by the team. Next, the technical team provisioned access to key systems, empowering the AI to take fast action. Effectively, the AI agent became an extended member of the WeightWatchers team.\nEngaging members with empathy\nBefore deploying broadly, WeightWatchers planned to test the AI agent within their mobile app on a small percentage of traffic, with the agent handling a hundred or so inbound inquiries at a time, to a small set of use cases. The team then planned to pause the agent after the trial in order to evaluate, recalibrate, and test again. After the first test, however, the work group was impressed.\n“I knew the AI agent would answer questions quickly, but I didn’t expect the responses to be so genuine and empathetic,” says Maureen. “I was reading chat transcripts with members exchanging heart emojis with the AI agent, or seeing the AI agent wish people good luck, or explain that it would be here if someone had to leave.”\nRather than pausing after their initial test as they had planned, WeightWatchers deployed their AI agent, and quickly expanded the breadth of use cases that it was assigned to solve. Soon after, they began planning to deploy the AI agent across all WeightWatchers customer touch points. “When I went to a recent leadership team meeting, I shared a few conversations. It’s not even something you can explain - you have to read the threads to feel their impact. Seeing is believing,” explains Maureen.\nMaureen Martin, VP of Customer Care at WeightWatchers\n“\nI knew the AI agent would answer questions quickly, but I didn’t expect the responses to be so genuine and empathetic. I was reading chat transcripts with members exchanging heart emojis with the AI agent, or seeing AI wish people good luck.\n”\nMaureen Martin\nVP of Customer Care, WeightWatchers\nScaling success across every channel\nTo evaluate the performance of their self-service tools, WeightWatchers has historically measured customer satisfaction and containment rate, which is the rate at which a chatbot can address queries and issues without the need for human intervention. With Sierra, WeightWatchers AI agent was able to contain nearly 70% of all cases within the first week, while continuing to deliver a greater than 4.5/5 score in customer satisfaction.\nTrust is paramount\nAs much as the customer care and operations workgroup leads were focused on making sure customers were getting the right answers and that the AI agent was staying on brand, their IT and security counterparts were fiercely focused on trust.\n“Our technology team has been playing the part of Devil's Advocate, writing in questions to trip the AI agent up,” Maureen explains. “And it is great to look at those examples and recognize that the AI has understood, identified, and caught the misuse.\"\nBeyond stress testing how the agent responds to unusual requests, the WeightWatchers technology team was committed to security and protecting customer data and private information. Sierra agents are built with best-in-class access controls, data governance, audit logs, inspection tools, and continuous quality assurance, and were able to meet the comprehensive trust and security requirements of the WeightWatchers team.\nWhat’s next for customer care?\nBeyond the tremendous increase in containment rate and continued customer satisfaction, WeightWatchers began to see the AI agent make impact on other areas of Customer Care.\nThe drop in average handle time was notable: “You always think about average handle time from the internal perspective, related to cost,” says Maureen. “What I began to realize was that the agent was also giving a tremendous amount of time back to the customer.”\nMaureen is optimistic about what lies ahead. “Essentially, AI helps us keep up with the changing demands, making it easier to deliver a high-quality responses as we grow across channels.”\n“\nEssentially, AI helps us keep up with the changing demands, making it easier to deliver a high-quality response as we grow across channels.\n”\nMaureen Martin\nVP of Customer Care, WeightWatchers\nAbout the company\nWeightWatchers is the global leader in weight health, on a mission to create a worldwide community connected by healthy habits.\nVisit site\nWith Sierra since\nOctober 2023\nFeaturing\nMaureen Martin\nVP of Customer Care\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "content": "How Wilson® applies a century of craftsmanship to its consumer experiences. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nWilson Sporting Goods is an American icon. Its century-long success is built on craftsmanship, innovation and performance, with a mission to empower every human to live like an athlete.\nSpeed, efficiency\nand\nquality\nSo when Wilson decided it was time to implement AI to elevate their consumer experience, they wanted a partner who cared as much as they did about performance. As Mary Craven from their CX team explains, “Wilson’s challenge wasn’t a lack of ideas — it was how to handle our email volume effectively. Our inbox was overflowing with everything from order tracking to returns to warranty questions. We needed an immediate solution that would enable Wilson to provide high quality answers in a timely manner.”\nUsing Sierra’s Agent Studio, Wilson’s CX team was able to launch within weeks — building customer journeys in natural language, without the need for code or engineering support, that they can continuously update and improve.\nBetter answers and new insights\nToday Wilson is focused on key areas including order tracking for stock and custom orders, FAQs regarding discounts or promotions on the sites, and return and warranty questions.\nAs Mary said: “Each of these reflects real consumer needs we saw every day. Order tracking is one of our highest-volume inquiries, especially for custom orders. Consumers want to know, 'When is my custom glove arriving?' or check the status of their custom uniforms. The AI agent handles all of that instantly. Consumers can see exactly where their order is without waiting for an email response.\"\nThe AI agent can even handle more nuanced questions. Take sizing, for example. Before, Wilson might receive an email asking:\nWhat size glove should I buy for my XX-year-old?\n, without any other context. Now, the agent can ask how tall they are, and whether they prefer a looser or tighter so they can recommend the right fit, versus a generic, off the shelf answer*. Says Mary, “It’s like every customer having access to a knowledgeable agent 24/7.”\nIn addition to reducing email volume, the agent also revealed opportunities to better serve customers. The agent revealed knowledge gaps, like missing product information or sizing details, that the team could quickly address by updating the content snippets and knowledge that powers the agent. As Mary explains: \"We can now identify what information our consumers need and add it directly and easily into the system. It helps us continuously improve how we answer their questions—a benefit we didn't anticipate but now see as critical.\"\n“\nWe can now identify what information our consumers need and add it directly and easily into the system. It helps us continuously improve how we answer their questions—a benefit we didn't anticipate but now see as critical.\n”\nMary Craven, Director, Consumer Experience\nPerformance in practice\nSince launch, the agent has already resolved tens of thousands of conversations, with more than 77% containment. For Wilson's consumers, this means instant answers instead of a potential 24-hour wait for an email response—whether they're checking on a custom bat order late at night or looking up sizing details on mobile before practice. The answers they receive are also being continuously upgraded to meet their needs.\nThe improved experience also unlocks benefits for Wilson’s team and business: the consumer experience team can now focus on more strategic work and building deeper connections with consumers, while the business gains real-time visibility into what consumers need, enabling them to identify trends and make more meaningful improvements faster.\nWhat’s next\nLooking ahead, Wilson’s AI agent is expanding into product recommendations, streamlined returns processing, and inventory. As Mary says: \"This is all about continuously listening to our consumers and giving them what they need, when they need it. We want every answer at their fingertips so they can get back to the game. That's what great experiences mean to us.\"\n“\nThis is all about continuously listening to our consumers and giving them what they need, when they need it.

    "title": "How Thrive Market is scaling healthy living with AI. | Sierra",
    "content": "How Thrive Market is scaling healthy living with AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nThrive Market was founded with a big idea: that healthy, sustainable living shouldn’t be a luxury. Today, the mission-driven, membership-based online retailer serves millions of families with ethically sourced, organic, and non-GMO products, shipped carbon-neutrally.\nBut delivering on that promise at scale is no small feat. As Thrive Market expanded, so did the volume and complexity of member interactions, from service enquiries to retention challenges. “Our mission is to make healthy and sustainable living easy and affordable,” says Sasha Siddhartha, Thrive Market’s CTO and Co-Founder. “And the member experience has to deliver on that. It needs to be personalised, immediate, and reliable.”\nSince its founding, Thrive Market relied on a support team to handle member inquiries. In recent years, the team introduced basic automation tools to help scale, but these systems were still rigid, template-based, and required constant manual upkeep. \"They weren’t truly conversational,” Sasha explains. “But even those early tools helped us realise the power of giving members what they really want: fast, clear answers without the wait.”\nFrom automation to intelligence\nWhen Thrive Market began its search for a more advanced solution, the team had high standards. “We’re a company that values test-and-learn,” Sasha notes. “We needed a partner who could help us prove value fast, through real experiments and measurable outcomes.”\nThrive Market chose Sierra to power its AI-driven member support. Built on Sierra’s platform, the AI agent now handles a wide range of member interactions.\nThe early results showed a clear impact. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, Thrive Market saw over a 50% improvement in case resolution, enabling more member questions to be resolved instantly—without human involvement. Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) for AI-handled interactions reached nearly 90%, reflecting strong member approval.\nSmart testing meets better member care\nThrive Market stands out not only for its mission, but for how deeply it applies data and experimentation to every decision, including its use of AI.\n“We’ve always been a company that values learning velocity,” Sasha explains. “The ability to run A/B tests with the agent, and to test new messaging strategies or offers in real time, is something that’s been really hard to do with traditional service tools. With Sierra, it’s now part of our regular workflow.”\n“\nWe’ve always been a company that values learning velocity. The ability to run A/B tests with the agent, and to test new messaging strategies or offers in real time, is something that’s been really hard to do with traditional service tools. With Sierra, it’s now part of our regular workflow.\n”\nSasha Siddhartha, CTO and Co-Founder\nThe Thrive Market team is constantly refining the agent’s logic, tone, and flows based on real member feedback and performance data. That ability to learn and adapt has turned the agent into a high-performing extension of Thrive Market’s brand, not just a support tool.\nAnd the branding is no accident. Thrive Market's original support persona was known as Kelly, designed to reflect a knowledgeable, compassionate guide in the health and wellness space. As the company transitioned to AI, the team introduced Olive, a new expression of that same ethos. “Our members are trusting us with really personal information, about their health goals, their diets, their families,” Sasha says. “They want to feel understood. The AI agent needs to be fast and efficient, yes, but also warm and smart.”\nScaling personalisation across the member journey\nWhile the current agent primarily lives in chat, Sasha sees a much bigger future. “The goal is to make Sierra the first point of entry for nearly every member interaction,” he says. That includes expanding to voice, email, SMS, and even proactive outreach during operational hiccups. But the most exciting horizon is where AI goes beyond support entirely.\n“We’ve always had this vision of a guided grocery experience,” Sasha shares. “Think of it like a personal shopper for your health goals, someone who can recommend products, answer questions, help you onboard, and evolve with you over time.”\nThe Thrive Market team is already exploring conversational AI in other parts of the customer experience, from product discovery to onboarding. “Once you get there,” Sasha says, “you unlock a whole new world filled with more data, more context, and more ways to personalise how we show up for our members.”\nA CTO’s advice\nFor Sasha, who leads Thrive Market’s entire technology stack—from engineering to product to IT—the key to success with AI isn’t hype. It’s diligence.\n“There’s a lot of noise out there,” he says. “A year ago, it wasn’t obvious which vendors were real, which use cases were production-ready. So we treated this like any other software investment. We had specific problems to solve, metrics to hit, and expectations to manage.”\nThat grounding has served Thrive Market well. With Sierra, the team found a partner who could match that rigour, and move fast.\n“AI isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it thing,” Sasha says. “It needs to be trained, observed, and optimised. But when you do it right, it’s a powerful way to drive impact. And we’re just getting started.”\nAbout the company\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail and Consumer Goods\nFeaturing\nSasha Siddhartha\nCTO and Co-Founder\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "content": "How Madison Reed gives customer experience a glow-up with AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nMadison Reed disrupted an industry that lacked innovation for decades.\nBuilt on a bold mission to empower its guests to feel their most confident and unstoppable, Madison Reed has always done things differently—including its use of technology. From algorithmic color matching to virtual try-ons, the brand consistently embraces innovation to deliver more confident experiences and more beautiful results.\nSo when it came to customer experience, the bar was already high.\n“I created Madison Reed because I believed women deserved better and that drives our decision-making every day,” says Amy Errett, CEO & Founder of Madison Reed. “As our business grows, we needed a partner that shared our obsession with quality, empathy, and customer connection.”\nThat’s where Sierra came in.\nScaling a subscription brand with AI that feels personal\nAs a subscription-driven business with both eCommerce and in-person Hair Color Bar channels, Madison Reed has always prioritized fast, expert support across customer touchpoints. But traditional support tools weren’t designed to drive growth while reflecting the warmth and confidence of the Madison Reed brand.\nAI had already played a role in other parts of the business, but customer experience presented a new opportunity: to use AI not just to support customers, but to empower them. The team saw a chance to bring their brand voice to life in every conversation, while delivering the kind of proactive, revenue-driving support a traditional model couldn’t.\nMadison Reed deepened its AI offerings by partnering with Sierra to bring that vision to life. The initial objectives included training an AI agent skilled in customer support chat to reduce churn, making product discovery more accessible, and booking appointments with ease across the brand’s 97 Hair Color Bars.\nThat agent became “Madi,” the brand’s AI agent built on Sierra.\n“Madi is the digital extension of our brand,” says Errett. “She’s there to wave, to say ‘Hello Beautiful,’ and to help every customer feel seen. Sierra gave us the technology to bring her to life with intelligence, empathy, and personality.”\nMadi shows up wherever customers are—across web, chat, and SMS—delivering 24/7 support and seamless transitions between channels and human experts.\n“Sierra had the right platform to build the AI agent experience we needed,” says Errett. “What set them apart wasn’t just the tech—it was how intentionally they worked with us to make sure Madi\nfelt\nlike Madison Reed. That’s the difference between generic automation and brand-building AI.”\n“\nWhat set Sierra apart wasn’t just the tech—it was how intentionally they worked with us to make sure Madi felt like Madison Reed. That’s the difference between generic automation and brand-building AI.\n”\nAmy Errett,\nMadison Reed CEO\nReal results across the customer journey\nSince launching Madi, Madison Reed has seen dramatic results across customer experience and business performance. All chat-based customer conversations are now fully automated, freeing up the brand’s “Color Crew” support team to focus on high-touch consultations and in-person salon care.\nMost importantly, Madi is delivering real impact to the bottom line. With 24/7 chat availability the brand is seeing a 30x increase in chat interaction with a 2x increase in guests’ likelihood to book an appointment, while subscription cancellations are cut in half for customers working with Madi.\n“We are already seeing meaningful revenue generation and cost savings resulting from this agent,” says Errett. \"Madi is already improving our customer lifetime value, increasing bookings, and reducing our cancellation rate.”\nAs it has scaled to handle up to 100% of Madison Reed’s online traffic, Madi has quickly become a core part of the customer journey—boosting loyalty, driving revenue, and deepening brand connection.\n“Sierra helps us deliver on the promise of personalization at scale,” says Errett. “This isn’t about replacing human connection—it’s about extending it. And it’s helping us grow stronger, faster, and more meaningfully with every conversation.”\nA future built on trust and tech\nFor Madison Reed, AI is a reflection of its values: courage, trust, love, responsibility, and joy. “Great brands don’t just keep up with their customers' needs—they anticipate them,” says Errett. “With Sierra, we’re making our customers feel confident, connected, and cared for.”\nAbout the company\nMadison Reed is transforming at home hair color with ammonia free hair dye that results in multi-dimensional color that looks beautiful, healthy and natural.\nVisit site\nFeaturing\nAmy Errett\nCEO\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "content": "How AOL modernizes a heritage brand using AI-powered customer service with Sierra.\n| Sierra\nSkip to main content\nFor over 35 years, AOL has been a household name, bringing ease and simplicity to internet access.\nAt its core, the brand has always been about connecting users with powerful, relevant, and trusted online experiences. Today, AOL welcomes over 37 million monthly active users across its ecosystem, which brings together top headlines, email and expansive content across entertainment, business, lifestyle, and more.\nAs Brendan Jennings, General Manager of AOL, explains: “Over the past few years, we’ve made significant investment in revitalizing the product experience to help users make the most of their online time. This innovation is deeply embedded into every facet of our user experience, spanning all product interactions and customer care touch points. The relationship we’ve cultivated with our audience has underpinned the stability and longevity of our brand—and excellence in customer care is paramount to this relationship.”\n“\nThe relationship we’ve cultivated with our audience has underpinned the stability and longevity of our brand—and excellence in customer care is paramount to this relationship.\n”\nBrendan Jennings, General Manager of AOL\nRevitalizing customer care with AI\nLeading AOL’s customer care transformation is Carly Swanberg, VP of Global Customer Care. With over a decade of experience at AOL, Carly is the driving force behind the company’s push to modernize its approach to customer service. Her philosophy is bold: embrace change, innovate, and build solutions that meet customer needs.\n“We’re not just maintaining a brand; we’re revitalizing it,” Carly explains. “AOL has a unique demographic of loyal customers, many of whom prefer traditional phone support channels. Our challenge is to maintain familiar support methods, while introducing tools and approaches that enable more seamless and efficient experiences.”\n“\nOur challenge is to maintain familiar support methods, while introducing tools and approaches that enable more seamless and efficient experiences.\n”\nCarly Swanberg, VP of Global Customer Care\nDeploying AOL’s first AI agent\nTo modernize its customer support, AOL partnered with Sierra to deploy its first AI agent. The agent focuses on delivering personalized, responsive support for a wide range of customer needs, ensuring a comprehensive experience that addresses pressing concerns.\nBilling inquiries\nThe AI agent explains outstanding balances, often caused by expired or deactivated credit cards, and negotiates resolutions. It does more than notify users of issues; it offers proactive solutions like personalized waivers, customized for each unique situation. The agent then assists with updating the user’s information to clear up their balance.\nPayment method updates\nThe AI agent eliminates friction by directly performing credit card switches or updates. It handles the entire process, from making the changes to verifying their accuracy. For users facing technical difficulties, the agent can swiftly troubleshoot and escalate issues to a live agent when necessary—ensuring every query is resolved.\nBilling breakdown\nUsers get detailed explanations of charges, fluctuations, and billing history. This feature clarifies amounts owed and contextualizes charges based on previous billing cycles, promotions, or service adjustments.\nGeneral questions\nThe agent provides comprehensive answers to common queries, from troubleshooting login issues to managing account settings. It can also guide users to additional resources or escalate more complex issues to a live agent.\nThe results of AOL's AI-driven approach\nAOL’s AI agent was a transformative step, offering users a more intuitive way to resolve issues. The results were significant: AOL achieved a 64% case resolution rate, with most inquiries handled entirely by the AI agent.\nWhat’s next for AI and automation in customer care\nMany of AOL’s loyal customers prefer speaking directly with a representative, and these conversations often stretch over 20 minutes, reflecting the company’s deep commitment to listening, understanding, and resolving customer issues.\n“Our calls are long because they need to be,” Carly explains. “We troubleshoot, empathize, and ensure people feel heard. That’s something we’ll never compromise on. But the challenge is clear—how do we scale these amazing, high-touch experiences without losing what makes them special?”\nWith an eye to the future, Carly and her team are working to automate identity verification. They are also planning to expand their AI agent to engage users on phone calls, eliminating hold times while providing natural and delightful support. All of this will free up AOL’s human agents to focus on solving complex issues, and delivering personalized care.\nCarly’s team also aspires to achieve a comprehensive and detailed view of all call and chat interactions, solving broad problems in real time. “Today, if there is an issue, someone needs to report it, after which it is voted on before being flagged to our team,” explains Carly. “With Sierra, we are excited to spot emerging issues at a much earlier stage, allowing the team to act faster and with greater precision.”\nBy combining AI capabilities with its tradition of personalization and empathy, AOL is creating a scalable, modern support system, demonstrating that legacy brands can lead in a changing landscape.\n“\nWith Sierra, we are excited to spot emerging issues at a much earlier stage, allowing the team to act faster and with greater precision.\n”\nCarly Swanberg, VP of Global Customer Care\nAbout the company\nVisit site\nIndustry\nTechnology\nFeaturing\nCarly Swanberg\nVP of Global Customer Care\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How OluKai scales the Aloha Experience with Sierra | Sierra",
    "content": "How OluKai scales the Aloha Experience with Sierra | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nMelissa Ziegler, VP of Marketing at OluKai\nBuilding an authentic brand\nFounded in 2005, OluKai stands out as the only Hawaiian-inspired brand crafting lifestyle and footwear for discerning, active consumers. OluKai created the category of premium leather sandals, and has since broadened its product catalog to include an innovative and versatile array of men's and women's footwear.\nThe company’s sustained growth accelerated as OluKai began a strategic pivot to direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution. This shift, complementing their robust wholesale operations with a strong e-commerce presence, aimed to create a digital customer experience mirroring the brand’s core values: Aloha, Ohana, and uncompromised quality.\nAfter 2020, the DTC channel surged to drive a significant portion of the company’s revenue. Currently, OluKai is transitioning into a dynamic omni-channel brand, growing through wholesale, brick-and-mortar, and ecommerce across owned channels and Amazon.\nCreating the Aloha Experience\nAs OluKai grew its online business, the company made a strong commitment to ensuring every digital interaction with customers was excellent. This led to the creation of the Aloha Experience, an end-to-end journey for customers that makes sure every contact, whether through ads, social media, the web, email, or phone, aligns with OluKai's vision of connecting the world through Aloha.\nTo make the Aloha Experience real, OluKai brought its customer service team into the marketing organization under Melissa Ziegler, VP of Marketing, and renamed these service team members as Day Makers. Day Makers do more than just respond to service inquiries; they aim to build long-lasting relationships and create delightful experiences with each interaction. Whether replacing a sandal chewed by a dog or responding to unique customer needs, every interaction is a chance to deepen that connection with customers.\nKerry Konrady, Chief Marketing Officer at OluKai\n“\nIt's easy to be authentic when you are tiny. To grow while remaining authentic is the biggest challenge brands have.\n”\nKerry Konrady\nChief Marketing Officer, Olukai\nHow do you scale Aloha?\nAt OluKai, customer service inquiries come through phone, email, and social media. As the company continued to grow, the increases in volume were making it difficult to maintain its targeted response time. John Elkins, the Aloha Experience Team supervisor, notes, \"75% of the requests are common issues like missing orders or return requests. We try to add a personal touch, but it can get monotonous.”\nMelissa wanted to shift the Aloha Experience Team’s focus from handling repetitive tasks to enhancing customer loyalty. “We’ve always encouraged our teams to take their time and understand the customer. If a customer had a big life event, I want you to meet that person with the appropriate level of enthusiasm.”\nLike many service teams, the Aloha Experience Team had already standardized in-app responses to common customer inquiries. OluKai had implemented and quickly decommissioned chatbots, finding them lacking in speed or efficacy. Melissa reflects, \"Chatbots frustrated our customers more than they helped. Direct email interactions proved to be more satisfying.\"\nWith the company scaling faster than ever, it was time to try something new.\nBuilding the OluKai AI agent\nMelissa, John, and the entire Aloha Experience Team ventured into the realm of AI, using Sierra to develop OluKai’s first AI agent. The AI agent would be able to apply the power of LLM natural language processing and reasoning to OluKai’s customer service, using the information, policies, brand and culture that make OluKai unique.\nMelissa was cautiously optimistic about the AI's capabilities, “AI will probably be able to read our policies, but will it understand how and when to make exceptions? To give that personal touch?”\nPost-launch, the results were remarkable. “Observing the AI agent respond empathetically to customers, mirroring the approach of our human agents, was astounding,” Melissa reflects. “AI has significantly reduced our team's workload on repetitive tasks, letting us to focus on the more impactful customer interactions,” adds John.\nThis advancement greatly helped the internal team. John explains, \"With the AI taking on routine questions, our Day Makers can concentrate on more complex cases. This helps us create moments of delight, and also makes our jobs more rewarding and fun.”\nMelissa Ziegler, VP of Marketing\n“\nObserving the AI respond empathetically to customers, mirroring the approach of our human agents, was astounding.\n”\nMelissa Ziegler\nVP of Marketing, Olukai\nSmarter, happier returns\nOluKai provides several return options for customers, including offering to send a prepaid shipping label or the eco-friendly, cost-effective Happy Returns service. Many customers, however, aren't familiar with Happy Returns. OluKai's AI agent works to promptly educate customers about Happy Returns and suggest the nearest location.\nUnlike a human agent, who would need to manually search for this information, the AI agent streamlines the process, making it quicker for customers and less cumbersome for staff. Derek Bradley, VP of Operations, notes, “Sierra can explain the value of a Happy Return and share nearby locations instantly, creating a better consumer experience while helping us save costs with a more efficient return.”\nDerek Bradley, VP of Operations at OluKai\n“\nThe OluKai AI agent can explain the value of a Happy Return and share nearby locations instantly, creating a better consumer experience while helping us save costs with a more efficient return.\n”\nDerek Bradley\nVP of Operations, Olukai\nThe AI agent also excels in understanding subtleties and nuances. For instance, OluKai has a 30-day return policy, but they are willing to make exceptions. “Being 5 or 6 days late is a gray area. Generally, we approve the return and educate customers on the policy for future purchases,” Melissa Ziegler explains.\nThe AI agent effectively adopts this flexible approach, “reconciling our stated rules and policies with gray area exceptions.” This capability demonstrates the AI's proficiency in not just following policies but also in adapting to individual customer needs with understanding and care.\nMeasuring the success of AI\nTo evaluate customer reactions to the OluKai AI agent, the Aloha Experience Team tracks customer ratings for each conversation and monitors them on a performance dashboard. Sierra currently delivers a Customer Satisfaction score of about 4.5 out of 5. “We have very high expectations, and are aiming for 4.75,” shares Melissa. “We think improving personalization and encouraging the AI to deliver moments of delight will get us there.”\nOluKai also tracks and monitors average handle time and average response time. Aloha Experience Team members will typically respond to a customer inquiry in between 2 to 48 hours, depending on the busyness of the period. “Conversely, AI is immediate, with your first response time and total average handle time dropping to virtually nothing,” says Melissa. “And, if you're a consumer like me who remembers something at 2AM, I can get a response from an AI agent 24/7/365.”\n“\nAI is immediate, with your first response time and total average handle time dropping to virtually nothing.\n”\nMelissa Ziegler\nVP of Marketing, OluKai\nFinally, OluKai measures the resolution rate of the AI Agent. Approximately 70% of the time the OluKai AI Agent is able to resolve a ticket or inquiry without human intervention. “Clearly understanding resolution rate allows me to make decisions between where we're investing our resources.”\nFor example, the shift to AI has adjusted the targets of the Aloha Experience Team (AXT). John Elkins, AXT Supervisor, shares, \"Previously, our focus was on closing 150 tickets daily. With Sierra, we've reduced ticket volume expectations, allowing our team to concentrate on more complex cases with empathy and care.\"\nJohn Elkins, Aloha Experience Supervisor\n“\nWith Sierra, we've reduced ticket volume expectations, allowing our team to concentrate on more complex cases with empathy and care.\n”\nJohn Elkins\nAloha Experience Supervisor at OluKai\nThe future of the Aloha Experience\n\"Retention is the new buzzword in consumer e-commerce, but it has always been a cornerstone for Olukai. Taking care of our loyal consumers, and treating them as members of our family is part of our brand ethos,\" says Melissa. \"The idea of a computer, taking over such a critical part of our marketing mix, was scary at first. Then watching AI learn, grow, and behave in ways that take months to train human agents, was a lightbulb moment for me in working with Sierra.\"\nWith Sierra now handling 70% of OluKai’s service tickets, the Aloha Experience Team is looking for new ways to innovate with the OluKai AI agent. “How do we surprise and delight customers, and engage them proactively?” asks John Elkins, Aloha Experience Team Supervisor. The team is exploring ways to share travel tips, or proactively message customers who might have experienced a delayed delivery.\n“We want to use our Customer Data Platform (CDP) to personalize the experience for customers,” explains Dan Kaparski, Director of Digital Products. “Then use the AI agent to deliver an experience to a long-time customer that is above and beyond what we might deliver to a first-time buyer.”\nMelissa elaborates, “If I’m chatting with a customer who has bought a pair of sandals 6 times, I might want to offer a code for a free pair of sandals that she can send to a friend. That’s an incredible experience, and helps perpetuate a lifelong relationship.”\nThe team is considering how the OluKai AI agent could drive revenue. Melissa considers, “We would love for the AI to share product information that helps customers make buying decisions, or engage someone before they abandon a shopping cart… the possibilities with AI are very exciting.”\n“\nSierra enables us to scale and reach more customers, all while using our voice, delivering white glove service, and creating the Aloha experience.\n”\nKerry Konrady\nChief Marketing Officer, OluKai\nAbout the company\nFounded in 2005, OluKai stands out as the only Hawaiian-inspired brand crafting lifestyle and apparel for discerning, active consumers.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail & Apparel\nWith Sierra since\nJuly 2023\nFeaturing\nMelissa Ziegler\nVP Marketing, OluKai\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit.\nReduction in subscription cancellations\n50%\nHair color trailblazer Madison Reed gives customer experience a glow-up with AI."

    "content": "How Chubbies Delivers Weekend Vibes with AI | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nChubbies’ journey from rebellious idea to cultural phenomenon, now powered by AI\nChubbies was founded in 2011 by a group of fashion pioneers with a rebellious streak and a desire to treat every day like the weekend. Their first product was a simple yet bold creation: men’s retro short shorts of the ‘70s and ‘80s. Beyond the products, the founding friends created a brand that was more about fun than fashion.\nWhat began as a niche idea quickly grew into a cultural phenomenon, with Chubbies becoming synonymous with weekend vibes, irreverent humor, and a community-driven approach to apparel. The brand’s loyal following isn’t just about the clothes—it’s about the experience, the camaraderie, and the laughter that Chubbies brings into their customers’ lives.\nExpanding the Chubbies experience with Sierra’s AI\nAs Chubbies expanded, so did their ambitions. They wanted to scale their business while staying true to the unique brand personality that set them apart. This meant maintaining their playful, engaging customer experience even as they grew and diversified product lines. It wasn’t just about shorts anymore—Chubbies was becoming a full-fledged lifestyle brand, and the stakes were higher. Every touchpoint with customers had to reflect the brand’s ethos, from the first click on their website to post-purchase interactions.\nRecognizing the need for cutting-edge technology to support their growth, Chubbies turned to Sierra to help them maintain the delicate balance between scalability and brand authenticity. The solution? Duncan Smuthers, an AI agent designed for customer service and built to embody the heart and soul of Chubbies.\nMeet Duncan Smuthers: The AI agent that feels like a friend\nDuncan Smuthers is no ordinary AI agent. Built on the Sierra platform, he’s a digital representative who doesn’t just answer questions—he does so with the wit, charm, and irreverence that Chubbies customers have come to expect. Whether he’s making a pun about poolside fashion or helping someone find the perfect fit for a weekend getaway, Duncan’s personality shines through, making every interaction feel personal and engaging.\nBut Duncan’s role extends far beyond just being a friendly face (or chat). Chubbies understood that clothing purchases are personal and that customers often have questions about size, fit, and style. Duncan was designed to handle these sensitive topics with empathy and care, ensuring that customers feel understood and supported, not just sold to. His ability to make customers laugh while also addressing their needs has made him an indispensable part of the Chubbies experience.\n“\nOur AI agent has helped us keep the fun, laid-back spirit of Chubbies alive in our customer support, while also driving real impact in how we connect with our customers and grow our business.\n”\nKit Garton, SVP, Commercial\nDriving business goals while keeping the fun alive\nWhile maintaining brand personality was crucial, Chubbies also had key business objectives that their AI agent needed to support. One major focus was optimizing the returns process. Returns can be a pain point for any retailer, but Chubbies saw it as an opportunity. With Duncan, they aimed to not only streamline returns but also encourage exchanges when appropriate. Sierra’s technology allows Duncan to seamlessly guide customers through the process, offering alternatives and keeping the experience positive, even when things don't go perfectly.\nAdditionally, Chubbies required Duncan to be deeply integrated into their operations and systems, including Loop and Gladly. Powered by Sierra, Duncan can pull up customer histories, manage orders, and even suggest products—all in real time. This level of integration ensures that customers receive real-time, accurate, and secure support without ever feeling like they are interacting with a machine.\nThe future of Chubbies: Scaling with Sierra and Duncan Smuthers\nSince implementing Duncan Smuthers, Chubbies has seen significant gains across the board. Customer satisfaction continues to be sky high, and the brand’s unique identity has been preserved—even enhanced—by the AI’s consistent, on-brand interactions. But for Chubbies, this is just the beginning. They’re already exploring new ways to use Sierra’s AI technology to further enhance the customer experience, from expanding Duncan’s capabilities to exploring new channels where Duncan can engage with customers.\n“\nDuncan, our AI agent, makes it easy for customers to return and exchange products instantly, any time of day. It’s great for shoppers and drives loyalty, while helping our service team focus on more nuanced customer conversations.\n”\nKit Garton, SVP, Commercial\nAs Chubbies continues to grow, they remain committed to the principles that got them here: a strong brand identity, a deep understanding of their customers, and a willingness to innovate. With Sierra’s AI at their side, Chubbies is poised to keep spreading joy, one pair of shorts—and one witty interaction—at a time.\nAbout the company\nChubbies, the brand that turned short shorts into a cultural movement, teams up with Sierra to introduce Duncan Smuthers, an AI agent with wit, charm, and a deep love for all things fun—making every interaction as unforgettable as the weekend itself.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail & Apparel\nWith Sierra since\nJune 2024\nFeaturing\nKit Garton\nSVP, Commercial\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "content": "How ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nFinding the perfect bra isn’t just about measurements—it’s about confidence, comfort, and feeling like yourself. ThirdLove understands this deeply.\nFor millions of women, bra shopping has long been a frustrating and emotional experience, often requiring compromises between style and fit. Co-founder and CEO Heidi Zak saw the industry’s shortcomings and set out to change them, launching a disruptive intimates brand known for its size-inclusive bras, half-cup sizes, and digital-first fit styling.\n“We’re doing more than just selling a bra—we’re helping a woman on a journey,” she explains. “For so many, this is about reclaiming comfort and confidence in their own skin. That’s what truly matters.”\nCurating human connection at scale\nTo make good on their mission, ThirdLove has always sought to create an experience that was supportive—both physically and emotionally—by prioritizing personalization at every touchpoint.\n\"I joined ThirdLove because I was drawn to the idea of customer experience (CX) being a core part of the business, not just an afterthought,” says Amber-Lynn Richey, ThirdLove’s Associate Director of Customer Experience. “Here, CX has a seat at the table alongside product designers and other key teams. This means we have real ownership, the ability to make meaningful changes, and the opportunity to build customer loyalty.”\nSupporting customers as they make an emotionally-charged and individualized purchase requires a great deal of empathy. But during peak seasons, delivering that same level of care at scale becomes even more challenging. ThirdLove needed a solution that could not only keep up with demand but also ensure every interaction—whether it was about fit, returns, or styling advice—felt just as thoughtful and supportive as speaking to a real stylist.\nMeet Barbra, ThirdLove’s AI stylist\nTo meet this challenge, ThirdLove partnered with Sierra to develop an AI agent built with the same care and intentionality as their bras. Unlike traditional chatbots, which often feel impersonal, ThirdLove’s AI agent—affectionately named\nBarbra\n—was designed to offer personalized guidance with the warmth of a real fit stylist.\n“Previous AI customer experience tools always hit a ceiling because customers simply didn’t want to engage with them,” says Amber-Lynn. “Even with extensive implementation efforts, automation rates stalled around 20-30% as customers often felt like they were being ‘put in a box.’ Sierra, on the other hand, adapts to what customers are asking in real time.”\nAmber-Lynn decided to deploy Barbra differently, embracing the flexibility and creativity of conversational AI. The team at ThirdLove has been intentional to ensure that Barbra isn’t just empathetic, but that she speaks the brand and customer’s language, avoiding industry jargon in favor of natural, intuitive phrasing.\n\"We don't ask customers to use the traditional language of the industry, like asking whether they can fit two fingers between the band and their body,\" explains Amber-Lynn. \"Instead, we use language that recognizes that fit is subjective. ‘Does it feel too tight, or just right?’\"\nTo maintain this level of authenticity, the team reviews Barbra’s interactions daily, making small, continuous refinements—just as they would with a team member. “Because it’s built to adapt,” says Amber-Lynn, “those refinements are easy—allowing us to keep the conversation as intuitive and comfortable as our products.”\n“\nBecause [the AI agent is] built to adapt, those refinements are easy—allowing us to keep the conversation as intuitive and comfortable as our products.\n”\nAmber-Lynn Richey, Associate Director, Customer Experience\nScaling during holiday and summer surges\nOne of the biggest benefits of the AI-driven approach for retailers like ThirdLove is to support customers effectively during peak seasons. The brand typically sees two major annual surges: a spike around May as customers refresh their summer wardrobes and another during Black Friday, which extends through the holiday season.\n“Interestingly, many of our customers, particularly moms, put off buying for themselves until after the holidays, so we see another rush in early December,” says Amber-Lynn.\nContrary to conventional wisdom, Amber-Lynn and her team designed Barbra’s initial use cases around the winter holiday rush.\n\"Peak seasons are always a challenge in retail—balancing a surge in demand, staffing shortages, and increased customer expectations,” says Amber-Lynn. “When we designed our AI strategy, we took what some might call a crazy approach: we launched it right over Black Friday, one of the most intense periods of the year. But we knew that if it worked then, it would set us up for even greater success in the spring, which is actually our biggest season.\"\nThis strategic deployment not only helped ensure that Barbra could handle peak-season inquiries, but also reduced the need for seasonal staffing. A key part of this was handling one of the most complex aspects of intimate apparel shopping—returns. Bras require a highly personal fit, making exchanges and returns inevitable. Barbra plays a crucial role in streamlining this process, answering sizing concerns, guiding customers through quick and easy returns, and even proactively recommending better-fitting alternatives.\nIn short order, Barbra was helping customers resolve an outsized number of cases. For a team that is committed to maintaining the brand's industry-high 92% customer satisfaction score, Barbra is becoming an essential asset to meet spikes in demand.\nPersonalization without limits\nLooking ahead, ThirdLove sees even greater potential in AI-driven support. “When a customer visits our site, we want her to feel like she has a personal shopper guiding her,” says Heidi. “AI should enhance personalization, not just react to customer needs, but anticipate them.”\nHeidi Zak, ThirdLove's co-founder and CEO\n“\nWhen a customer visits our site, we want her to feel like she has a personal shopper guiding her. AI should enhance personalization, not just react to customer needs, but anticipate them.\n”\nHeidi Zak, Co-founder and CEO\nAmber-Lynn adds, “We’re exploring deeper AI integration—think AR-powered fittings, proactive customer assistance, and omnichannel support that makes every interaction feel as natural as an in-store experience. The more we refine Barbra, the more she becomes a real partner in delivering the experience we’ve always envisioned.”\nThirdLove has set a new standard in intimate apparel, proving that technology and human connection can complement rather than compete with each other. By embracing AI in a way that enhances, rather than replaces, the emotional and personal aspects of their brand, they’ve crafted an experience that truly meets women where they are.\n“This isn’t about automation,” says Heidi. “It’s about making sure every woman feels understood, valued, and supported. AI should make a brand feel more human—not less. That’s the future we’re building.”\nAbout the company\nThirdLove is a modern intimates brand known for its inclusive approach to fit, offering bras and underwear in a wide range of sizes and half-cup options.\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail & Apparel\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nReduction in subscription cancellations\n50%\nHair color trailblazer Madison Reed gives customer experience a glow-up with AI."

    "content": "How melin delivered peak performance support in time for the holiday season with Sierra. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nCorey Roth and Brian McDonell, melin Co-Founders\nmelin is a performance headwear brand and a member of the Archipelago brand family, which also includes OluKai, Roark, and Kaenon. Known for crafting hats with superior materials and thoughtful design, melin’s community ranges from athletes to adventurers who value style and performance in their gear.\nCorey Roth, melin’s Co-Founder, describes their journey: “We wanted a better option when it came to our headwear choices, but it didn't exist. So we decided to create it.”\nIn early 2024, Archipelago\nlaunched its first AI agent\nfor the Hawaiian footwear brand OluKai. The launch was successful in terms of both brand extension and customer experience, and the next step was to determine how to expand these capabilities to melin.\nDespite the similarities in backend technology—and with peak season fast approaching—this deployment required a fresh approach as melin’s brand voice, customer needs, and inquiry volumes were all unique.\nGoing live in less than two weeks\nOne of the standout aspects of this deployment was speed. \"We wanted to see how we could reapply the lessons learned from OluKai and deploy them across different brands in our portfolio,\" said Dan Kaparski, Director of Digital Products.\nBuilding on learnings from OluKai, the team launched melin’s AI agent in under two weeks. The flexibility of Sierra’s platform helped melin to tailor the workflows and tone to align with their brand voice right from the start.\nThe impact was immediate. Within days of deployment, melin’s AI agent was resolving the majority of cases, freeing the team to focus on more complex issues just in time for peak season.\n“\nWe wanted to see how we could reapply the lessons learned from OluKai and deploy them across different brands in our portfolio.\n”\nDan Kaparski, Director of Digital Products\nA unique voice for a unique brand\nOluKai’s agent is all about the Aloha Experience, but melin’s AI agent takes a different approach. Whether it’s about materials, quality, or care, the agent delivers answers with clarity and efficiency, always cutting straight to the point and addressing product questions head-on. This makes it perfect for active consumers who value high performance gear over branding.\nAlmost all initial inquiries melin received were product-related—questions like “Are melin hats water resistant?” and “What is the difference between snapback and strapback?\" melin’s agent adapted to these nuances immediately, thanks to previous learnings from OluKai and a carefully crafted knowledge base.\nBut it's not just about answering product questions. The melin agent can also help customers take action by managing order statuses, facilitating returns and exchanges, reshipping lost orders, handling warranty claims, and managing promotions and discounts.\nAn always improving agent\nmelin was eager to move quickly and independently, taking advantage of Sierra's self-service knowledge base.\nAmanda Cook, Head of Customer Experience, began adding dozens of new articles, improving the agent by adding more information and enhancing its ability to respond to a greater variety of questions. Her investment led to a 6% increase in case resolution rates.\n“The ability to adapt our AI agent for melin’s unique brand voice in just two weeks proves that Sierra doesn’t just scale across brands—it tailors each experience with precision and speed,” says Amanda Cook. “This approach allowed us to deliver exceptional support right in time for the holiday rush, empowering both our team and our customers.”\n“\nThis approach allowed us to deliver exceptional support right in time for the holiday rush, empowering both our team and our customers.\n”\nAmanda Cook, Head of Customer Experience\nThe future of the melin experience\nmelin is now able go beyond just chat to transform their customer experience across channels. In the past 30 days, 47% of melin’s email volume has been successfully redirected to Sierra, streamlining their workflow and freeing up the team to focus on higher-value tasks. The melin team is also exploring ways to improve customer experience, from sharing performance tips with new customers to creating personalized recommendations for long-time fans of the brand.\nWith Sierra, melin is poised to turn every customer interaction—whether through chat, email, or other channels—into an opportunity to fuel adventure and deepen loyalty in the world of performance headwear.\nAbout the company\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail & Apparel\nFeaturing\nDan Kaparski\nDirector of Digital Products\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How Pendulum helps customers get health support with conversational AI. | Sierra",
    "content": "How Pendulum helps customers get health support with conversational AI. | Sierra\nSkip to main content\nPendulum Therapeutics was founded with a deep, personal purpose: to transform health through microbiome-targeted solutions. After her daughter's premature birth and extended stay in the NICU, Pendulum CEO Colleen Cutcliffe saw firsthand the impact of antibiotic overuse on the gut microbiome. This sparked her mission to restore microbiome health for individuals living with conditions like type 2 diabetes.\nDriven by a commitment to transparency, science and resilience, Cutcliffe and the Pendulum team developed Pendulum Glucose Control, a groundbreaking probiotic supplement designed to help with nutritional management in people with type 2 diabetes. Today, Pendulum's products not only address specific metabolic needs but also serve a growing community of people passionate about taking control of their health.\nAs Pendulum entered a period of rapid growth, the team realized that maintaining a high standard of care would require a scalable, repeatable customer experience (CX) solution.\nKasey Rubenstein, Pendulum’s Knowledge Base and Self-Service Lead, needed a way to ensure that customers felt fully supported in their health journeys, even as demand grew. “Our goal is to deliver customer happiness in a way that’s both scalable and personal,” Kasey shares. “With Sierra, we’ve been able to deploy a reliable, responsive AI agent that enables customer self-service to be supportive, even as our customers purchase complex products.”\n“\nWith Sierra, we’ve been able to deploy a reliable, responsive AI agent that enables customer self-service to be supportive, even as our customers purchase complex products.\n”\nKasey Rubenstein, Knowledge Base and Self-Service Lead\nUncovering the gaps in customer self-service\nPendulum’s direct-to-consumer model means customer inquiries span everything from product questions and recommendations, to account and subscription management, to order modifications. Before Sierra, the Pendulum team had implemented a workflow chatbot to enable customer self-service.\nAt first glance they were impressed with the relatively high case containment rates, with some use cases seeing 50% or higher case resolution. However, a closer look revealed that most of these cases were simply “deflected,” meaning customers had abandoned the conversation before their issues were actually resolved. This half measure translated into frustrated customers with unmet needs.\nAchieving higher satisfaction and case resolution with Sierra\nWith Sierra, Pendulum deployed their AI agent to successfully resolve a variety of customer inquiries. Kasey’s expertise in chat solutions and her QA oversight played a crucial role in the agent’s success. “We needed to rebuild trust in this channel, and that meant creating an experience that felt authentic and high-quality from day one,” Kasey explains. “We worked closely with Sierra’s team to test, refine and optimize every interaction.”\nSince implementing Sierra, Pendulum’s AI agent has not only improved successful case resolution—now over 75%—but also bolstered customer satisfaction. With CSAT scores trending above 4.3 out of 5, Pendulum is thrilled with the positive trajectory and continues to refine timing and messaging within the chat to further increase these scores. “Our customers deserve real solutions, not just robotic responses,” Kasey shares. “Sierra has given us a way to resolve cases effectively, showing customers that we’re here to help at every step.”\nHelping customers feel supported in their health journey\nPendulum’s products require careful guidance, as customers often have questions about the unique health benefits. In turn, great customer support is not just about responding to inquiries; it’s about helping customers feel supported in their health journey. With their AI agent handling key use cases, Pendulum can provide a faster, flexible, and more delightful experience.\nEven small enhancements to the self-service experience—like flexible authentication using email, zip code or order number—make support seem more accessible and convenient. Sierra allows Pendulum to address customers with more basic needs instantly, but also provides an easy path to escalate to human support for customers who need it most.\nSetting a new standard in health-driven customer experience\nPendulum’s partnership with Sierra is only beginning. Pendulum plans to extend the AI agent beyond chat, incorporating email support and, eventually, voice interactions. This expansion will allow Pendulum to offer a cohesive, high-quality experience across all customer touch points, reflecting the brand’s commitment to accessibility and customer-centricity.\n\"The impact has been tremendous,” says Kasey. “Now, when customers reach out, they get the answers they need, they easily get their problems solved, and they leave feeling supported. Sierra’s AI has allowed us to do more than just answer questions; it’s allowed us to build customer confidence.”\n“\nSierra’s AI has allowed us to do more than just answer questions; it’s allowed us to build customer confidence.\n”\nKasey Rubenstein, Knowledge Base and Self-Service Lead\nAbout the company\nVisit site\nIndustry\nRetail and Consumer Goods\nFeaturing\nKasey Rubenstein\nKnowledge Base and Self-Service Lead\nShare\nSee what Sierra can do for you\nFind out how Sierra can help your business build better, more human customer experiences with AI.\nLearn more\nMore customer stories\nVisionary startups and industry leaders use Sierra to grow stronger and faster.\nCSAT\n4.5/5\nResolution rate with Sierra\n70%\nHow OluKai scales the Aloha experience with Sierra.\nCSAT improvement\n+7 percentage points\nHow Tubi creates “magical moments” at scale with AI.\nHow ThirdLove uses AI to create a perfectly personalized fit."

    "title": "How AG1 uses AI to empower customers with a daily health ritual.  | Sierra",
    "content": "How AG1 uses AI to empower customers with a daily health ritual.\n| Sierra\nSkip to main content\nAG1, a leading global health company, is laser-focused on its bold mission: empowering individuals to take control of their health. With a core value of continuous improvement, AG1 fosters dynamic, personal customer relationships that inspire action, support daily rituals and celebrate progress.\nLeading this charge is Leala Francis, Senior Vice President of Customer Insights and Member Experience at AG1. Leala’s vision extends beyond serving AG1 customers, whom AG1 calls members; she is working to build one-to-one relationships and support AG1 customers in creating a daily habit of prioritizing their health every day.\n“Our customers seek support, guidance, and partnership in their wellness journey,” she says. “Many customers who build a daily routine tell us how it creates momentum and boosts their confidence to accomplish even more. We're here to help more people feel that sense of empowerment and take control of their health.”\nThe need for scale\nIn 2024, after years of immense growth, Leala identified the opportunity to further leverage technology in order to help the team scale to meet rapidly growing customer demand with a personalized approach. \"Our customer support team is outstanding but we were handling tens of thousands of inquiries a month manually,” Leala recalls.\nThe solution? Implementing an AI agent with Sierra to engage and support customers at scale. The AG1 agent manages a variety of tasks, from answering basic FAQs and tracking orders to handling more complex subscription needs like adjusting shipment dates, adding products, or changing shipping addresses. Beyond automating these processes, the AI agent embodies AG1's brand personality.\n“At AG1, our team personally responds to every single review, whether it’s giving a thumbs-up to a superfan or addressing a delayed package,” explains Leala. “Our AI agent allows us to focus on these individual relationship-building interactions, while still providing fast, accurate responses to common inquiries.”\nLeala Francis, SVP Customer Insights and Member Experience\n“\nThe AI agent frees up our team to focus on these one-to-one, community-building interactions, while still providing fast, accurate answers to common questions.\n”\nLeala Francis\nSVP, Customer Insights and Member Experience\nUnderstanding and predicting customer needs\nAs Leala began investigating all aspects of the AG1 customer experience, she discovered an interesting trend that AG1’s customers were more satisfied with chat support. “By shifting more inquiries to chat, where our AI agent can resolve them in real-time, we aim to deliver the kind of experiences our customers prefer.” said Leala.\nTo deliver a fantastic chat experience, AG1 trained its AI agent like a top support representative, equipping it with fast access to all necessary systems. A natural extension of the team, the AI agent uses real-time data like subscription history to offer tailored solutions when customers seek to modify orders. “If a customer is going on vacation, the agent can suggest pausing the subscription or offer travel packs,” Leala says. This approach has created a stronger connection for customers to AG1’s mission of supporting lifelong health journeys.\nThe impact of the AI agent was fast and meaningful: AG1 saw a double-digit percentage migration from email volume to chat. “We know that there is a relationship between faster response times and higher NPS,” Leala notes. “It's our job to meet our customer needs and support them on their health journey. We know that customers who get their answers quickly have a higher retention and are more likely to recommend us.”\nEnsuring quality performance\nAG1 has a high bar for customer engagement. With their support team consistently earning an average 4.9 CSAT across all interactions, Leala knew that maintaining this level of excellence with the new AI agent was critical.\nTo ensure the AI agent upheld AG1’s reputation for outstanding service, Leala had her team perform rigorous quality assurance. Their job was to evaluate the agent on two key fronts: technical performance and conversational soft skills. Every interaction was carefully rated on a scale from 1 to 5, looking at how well the agent handled inquiries and how naturally it communicated.\nOnce the AI agent was tested, refined, and fully deployed, the results spoke for themselves. The agent achieved perfect 5/5 scores 99% of the time, matching the highest standards of AG1’s human ambassadors. Customers appreciate the agent’s accuracy and flexibility, in addition to the speed and seamless experience delivered.\nGathering customer insights\nLeala’s approach goes beyond just handling inquiries—she views AI as a tool to gain a deeper understanding of AG1’s customers. One of the key tools in Leala’s strategy is Sierra’s Experience Manager, which provides powerful reporting and analytics to track customer trends and sentiment.\n“The data we get from Sierra helps us spot patterns we couldn’t identify before, right when issues or opportunities are emerging,” Leala explains. This ability to adapt quickly has allowed AG1 to stay ahead in delivering personalized, impactful customer experiences.\nLooking ahead\nWith Sierra’s AI agent handling an increasing volume of customer inquiries, Leala is excited about what’s next for AG1. She and her team are always considering new ways to enhance the customer experience. For example, using AI to act as a concierge when making a purchase decision - answering product questions and offering personalized recommendations to help customers make informed decisions with confidence.\n“For us, AI isn’t just about automation,” Leala says. “It’s about creating a seamless, personalized experience for every customer and making sure that we’re always there to support our customers in building healthy daily habits.”\nAbout the company\nAG1 (formerly Athletic Greens) is a global health company with a mission to empower people to take ownership of their health. The company’s flagship product, AG1, is a research-backed daily health supplement that combines a high-quality multivitamin, probiotic, and more into a single, powerful scoop.
